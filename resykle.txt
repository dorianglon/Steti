DAE like driving stoned? Whenever me and my friends smoke, I feel inclined to go for a drive somewhere. But some people get high and seem to lose their balls and all mobile ability.	DoesAnybodyElse	1255331368
Hey reddit, why should I quit smoking? I've been an on/off smoker (cigarettes) for a while now (I've been buying a pack every 1-2 weeks since college started). My problem is that I know smoking is bad, it smells, my parents disapprove (i go to a local community college so i live at home), but I can't seem to find a good reason to stop. Most of my friends smoke, I've made tons of friends by taking smoking breaks with them, I don't do anything physically draining that would require lung capacity (except bong hits lulz)I suppose a better question is; smokers of reddit, why did you stop smoking?	self	1260092494

Ever think about the things you do while stoned to appear sober? For example, if you're stoned and you're around your parents/authority figures, I tend to try to do and say things that I *think* are things i would do/say when I'm sober. Alternatively, maybe trying to appear normal and sober makes you seem even more stoned to everyone else. Just a thought.	Marijuana	1260393670

I have some pretty annoying insomnia, any advice on falling asleep? Don't say pot, I live with my parents so it's difficult to get away with it (plus it hasnt helped that much in the times i did try).Ever since new years when I had a panic attack, I've developed a pretty annoying case of insomnia. Even though i have to wake up at 6am on Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays because of a class at 8am, I still can barely fall asleep during the night. I have no idea why, and it's starting to transition from annoying to frustrating to slowly driving me insane.Any advice on how you guys overcame insomnia? I'm sure if I can adjust to some sort of decent sleeping schedule I'll be able to move past it, but my nights now tend to revolve around getting barely any sleep, and getting 9+. inb4FightClub	self	1262831538
Sup WATMM, I made this mix in ableton, care to critique/enjoy?

How do you get over someone? For some context, there was this girl that I really liked, that I met entirely on my own and had a thing for for quite a while but never took any action. Recently I became aware that it's kind of a good thing I didn't do anything because she comes off as extremely vain, manipulative, and self centered. However, I still feel hung up on her and can't seem to make myself realize it was for the best.tl;dr bitches ain't shit, but how do you make yourself believe that	relationship_advice	1263330415

So what songs/artists would you show to people who have never really listened to dubstep before?

Reddit, what process do you go through when trying to find a job? It hit me that I really need to get on finding a job just to have money to throw around, but the job situation is kind of strange in my area (a lot of entry level jobs, such as cashiers at fast food restaurants have been overtaken by either robots or underpaid immigrants). So I'm just wondering, how did YOU go about finding and GETTING a job? Is craigslist a viable option? Or is printing out a bunch of resumes and handing them out to stores a better idea?

Anyone here use Waves Plugins along with Ableton Live? I'm really at my wits end. I love Waves plugins (i even took a class on them), but I can't use them at all. Whenever I load even one up in Ableton, everything starts to fail. CPU instantly maxes out, I get horrible lag, and shit sound quality. I've tried using a different sound card, but to no avail. This is definitely a separate issue. Any ideas at all? I've tried loading them up in a different DAW and I STILL have the issue of CPU maxing out.

I think everyone on reddit should go watch "The Invention of Lying" before commenting on religion... Sure, it's a comedy movie, but I think it makes a lot of sense.spoiler alert here, but Ricky Gervais' character essentially makes up the idea of Heaven and Hell and the "Man in The Sky" to make people feel comfortable and happy with their lives, and to not be scared of death. That doesn't sound like a bad idea at all! Of course, just like in the movie, people took those ideas too far and morphed them to fit their own agendas.I'm an agnostic personally, and I'm really sick of seeing all the "religion is crap! don't believe that bullshit!" posts that seem to appear. Religion has never got in the way of my life, and I'm certain that some people really appreciate it's presence and guidance in their lives. 	self	1281073219

Beginning to lose faith in dubstep, someone help me out I got into dubstep for the bass, the beats, but mostly for the fact that it was a really energetic form of music that could get anyone jumping around. 2008-2009 were awesome in the way of artists like Datsik, Excision, Downlink etc creating what could be arguably called robo-step but that really fucking BOUNCED.I loved making mixes of that and then driving around with the bass cranked up on the stock stereo, and getting weird looks from everyone.But it seems that things have changed, I haven't seen a track in months that could even get me to nod my head along with it... It seems that everything became either about reproducing the old sound of dubstep (no wobble, ambient basslines, really based upon percussion) or just having pure noise as the lead in the song (looking at you, chronos records, dayn, flux pavilion...)**tl;dr: someone please show me some dubstep that's going to make me want to crank my speakers up.** [I know this isn't really dubstep, but this should give you the general idea of what i'm looking for](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGCc0WqvVT4)	dubstep	1283471437

I want you to post the "this is the problem with dubstep" songs in this thread Honestly, I was on another forum and the topic of dubstep came up ([this picture in particular](http://www.jointsubcommittee.com/mars/dubstepkeyboard.jpg)) and it got me thinking... What IS the most godawful song in dubstep? What song fully embodies the "problem" with this genre?For me, these songs kill it: [Funtcase - Make our day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFhgfdSoqDo) (I can handle wobbluz, but the yayayayas cause a part of my soul to die) [I also can't understand Flux pavillion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhSZi_wYyhU) he's had some sick chunez, but I'm never really a fan of the noisy-lead. I also really hate the "zomfg uber delay on drum samples for 5 minutes!" ambient shit, but statements like that are going to make all the /r/fg heads want to kill me.So what about you?

IAE a smoker, still have a soul, and feel fine with their decision? I'm not a pack a day smoker. I buy Nat Shermans every week or so and smoke them during breaks in class and before/after class. It's really the only way to get to know people at my school (community college), and tends to be a great social device in general. I know it's unhealthy, but I view the benefits as outweighing the cost. I know I can't keep this lifestyle up forever and will eventually have to quit, but until then... *lights one up*I don't understand why reddit hates smokers so much. For a hivemind all about letting people make their own decisions (i've even often read people argue that we should legalize ALL drugs and let people make their own decisions), you sure seem to have problems with it in reality.

The "I wanna make dubstep, but where do I start?" thread.  I've been seeing these a lot around here, and since I've been producing for a while now, I thought I'd give you all some pointers on how to start... also so these threads will stop popping up. More experienced producers shouldn't hesitate and call me a dumbass or correct me as, just like apparently everyone else in the music business, I have no idea wtf im doing. **1.) Structure.** Dubstep is *traditionally* 140 beats per minute, kick on the 1, snare on the 3. It moves in 16 bar phases before either a 1 bar break or the next phase. **2.) dat wubble**"dat wobble" can be achieved by assigning an LFO (low-frequency oscillator) to the filter cutoff of your chose synth. You then automate the LFO from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/16 or what have you to get... "dat wubble"**3.) what interface should I use?**It doesn't matter. Burial edits samples together in soundforge, Numbernin6 hits up Fruity Loops. It does not matter what DAW you use except for are you comfortable with it or not. I took classes on Pro Tools and found it unintuitive and a pain to use. I use Ableton Live now and it feels like second nature.**4.) Where are you getting all of this from?**If you choose to disregard my poorly written post, [You can always just go here, where dubstepforum.com has put together a very insightful and useful topic on how to produce](http://dubstepforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=159713)My personal advice to everyone is, if you want to make dubstep, start by NOT making dubstep. IMO the entire genre is saturated with "I wanna sound like Rusko/Datsik/Joy Orbison/what have you" so you end up with tons of songs that sound exactly the same.Be different. Try something that hasn't been done before, oscillate a guitar, sample a construction site, anything. 	dubstep	1287965233

PWNSTRZ So I think we should really get started on this. I came up with my 16 bar sample, so I suppose we could all post ours here and then see what we can use for the actual track.As for logistics, should we have each person write one part/melody/bassline/etc or just work on the song until they run out of ideas and send it to the next person?me: http://soundcloud.com/resykle/4-to-the-door-floor-sophomore-al-gore-jersey-shore	emp	1290383389

Who is down for an EMP Podcast? So back in the day (last year or so) i ran a podcast called [High Impact Noise](http://hin.galador.org/). It didn't have anything to do with anything and died several times... but the point is that we could do it here!Setting up a podcast is relatively simple, and I know how to do it via WordPress (it would also allow us to make blog posts, which is an added plus!)My plan is to have everyone who mixes submit a mix weekly to the podcast (trust me, it gets overwhelming pretty quick, especially if you're sending in hour long episodes), and we'll have them up for download!I want to hear your guys' thoughts on this	emp	1291331769

Do you 'try' to make a particular type of song or just let something form naturally? I've been having significant cognitive dissonance with this. I really just want to make a catchy, dancy tune that i could show to regular people when I mention I'm a producer. Hell, maybe even make a set and finally get a gig!But instead all that comes out is this deep, progressive, dark bass type shit. This is great and all, but it would be nice to be able to make something that actually, well, gets people to download my damn tracks and move on the dancefloor!For reference, this is my [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/resykle) and [this being the deep dark shit](http://soundcloud.com/resykle/submosphere-preview)----Anyway, how do you guys go about making your bangers? Were you just blessed with the gift of intrinsically knowing how to make danceable music or do you consciously try to make it? Is there a difference between being authentic and true to the music you make versus trying to bite styles?	edmproduction	1353636581

It's been another year, so what are some things you guys would like to see happen to r/dubstep in 2013? Any suggestions, ideas, whatever you have. I know this isn't the most technically engaging subreddit (no fancy menus like /r/movies anyway), but there are still things we could try to do. Do you think our current standards for what gets allowed into the sub are good? Too weak? Too Strong? Should we ban adjectives from titles? Should we have a "under 18 only" producer week? Let's hear it!	dubstep	1356849487

How much of a difference should the mastering process make? Or, is it fair to A/B a mastered track to a mixdown? To clear things up, I'm wondering how "good" a final mixdown should sound. Should it be able to compare against professionally mastered songs? Mixing tracks is definitely both my least and most favorite thing about the process. Starts off fun... but after a few hours i just hate myself. 	edmproduction	1358397972

So we've got a wiki, what should we use it for? http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/wiki/pretty neat, not too hard to edit either it turns out.So far I've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and how I would personally answer them. It's meant to be tongue-in-cheek, after you browse this subreddit enough you start seeing some patterns and recurring threads that are just... unnecessaryAnyway, I'm open to suggestions as to what we can do with this thing, I can add people to the approved editors list (i hope theres one) so you can have at it	dubstep	1367275974
Any hockey fans here? would be cool to overload some bar downtown during playoffs. I know there are some sharks fans from the bay but who knows?Wunderbar seems like a cool place so thats probably where i'll be, but if any of you end up meeting up anywhere else shoot me a message and hopefully we can arrange something cool for the next game!Go sharks!!

Are there any apps similar to VLC for Chrome? Apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit, but I'm wondering if there are any apps that can open external streaming links (like .pls and .m3u).Maybe I'm trying to use the Chromebook for something it isn't meant for, I just got this so I'm not really sure what's possible yet. Thanks!	chromeos	1368509965
Reminder: PLEASE put the artist and title of the track in your submission! Otherwise it will be removed! Just put it in there. "check this sick track out" is not really helpful. If it's a song, its made by someone. If it's a mix, it's been mixed by a DJ! i.e. "Resykle - Laying Down The Law [My sick new track!]" is totally acceptable as would "Resykle - 5/14 Chavstep Mix [super sick dubstep mix yo]"It makes things looks nicer and more organized, and it helps people searching to find your posts. This isn't aimed at anyone in particular, but until one of us mods figures out how to make one of those fancy banner announcement thingies making posts is the best I can do :(Also if youre posting a mix, its helpful to put some of the artists in the title as well, just to help it gain attention from those listening. Not even god knows how many different styles of dubstep there are now, so "Dubstep mix" could mean anything! Adding a "ft. tracks by x, y, and z" could go a long way towards helping your submission! Unless it's by an established artist already, in which case most people will already have an idea of what they're in for. thx have a good day	dubstep	1368597252

Opinions on fastening amplifiers to subwoofer enclosures? I'm getting a new amp + rewiring my system soon, and am wondering what your guys' thoughts are on attaching the amp to the subwoofer box. I've read a bunch of forums and it seems that opinions are split between it being a terrible idea, and not-so-bad if you have a decent amp.I understand that the vibrations may cause damage to the amp, but if you have one from a reputable company, shouldn't that have been addressed?I'm getting an Alpine MRV-M500 and hoping to attach it either on (or near) 2 12" JLs, if that helps as a reference for my situation EDIT: Thanks for the responses, looks like it's going on the back of the seat!

Some of you might remember my sub-bass challenge... well I got a new system and would love to make things shake! Post the bassiest tunes you've got! A while ago I posted a [sub-bass challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/nib2f/i_has_a_challenge_for_you_give_me_2_songs_that/), asking people to submit the most chest-rattling tunes they have. "Challenge" aside, everyone got introduced to great new music and good times were had.Today I [re-wired my car and stuck a new amp in](http://i.imgur.com/qkBPI2u.jpg), and now all that's left is to see how far I can push it before breaking something. I'd like to ask the same thing: post the deepest, dankest, hair-raisingest, chestplate shakingest, subwoofer breaking tunes you can think of.Is there a prize? Probably not, because the end results would be very subjective since I am only human (for now). But maybe I or someone enterprising could put the submitted songs into a mix, that way we could all win!Lemme start this shit off[Truth - Devil's Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLp1CnjMAkU&amp;hd=1)[Author - After Time (ft.

Anyone have experience with EL lighting setups? Thinking about adding a sound activated EL lighting rig to my car, but am having a hard time finding sources on an easy way to do so.I read that it's -possible- to hook up an inverter to the door speakers to have them be activated by the power, but I haven't seen any confirmation that such a thing even works. Anyone have any ideas?	CarAV	1377130136

Please read this before submitting! This is a quick rundown of the rules of this subreddit. No mercy.1. Dubstep only. This is /r/dubstep not /r/electronicmusic or /r/electrohouse. If you don't know what the term 'dubstep' constitutes, the drums should sound something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddjIfOhmhrco). 2. If you submit a DJ mix, at least 3/4 of the tracks in it have to be Dubstep. 3. Don't post tracks asking for feedback here. There is already a much better place for that at /r/edmproduction. People are here generally to just -listen- to music, not examine it critically. There are also not that many producers here so I'm not sure what you're expecting. 4. No images. No memes. 5.  Every single submission needs to have an Artist and Track title in the title. Do **not** tell us how 'epic' of a drop it is, or how 'filthy' it is, or how the guy making it is 8 years old. Just post the track and let us judge for ourselves. And definitely don't preface by telling everyone they need 'more exposure'. Although this doesn't seem that important, it is the easiest/best way to make sure everything looks structured and that people put thoughts into their submissions.6. Use the damn search. +* Use the damn search. Especially when looking for [female vocals](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/search?q=female+vocals&amp;restrict_sr=on) or [orchestral shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/search?q=orchestral&amp;restrict_sr=on) or anything related to "[drops](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/search?q=+drop&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)"This is a tentative topic while we figure out what best to use sticky posts for. Since nobody reads the sidebar anyway, this seems like a good place to post the rules for now. cheersUPDATE: **To get soundcloud links to embed use http:// not https://**	dubstep	1377635359

[LPT Request] How to watch sports without a cable network Semi-inspired by that "call and beg for extra channels" thread, I was wondering what some good ways were to watch sports without getting cable. I'm a hockey fan and it's really a pain in the ass to either find a stream that is consistent, one that is high quality, or one that doesn't get blackouts (fuck you gamecenter).I hear a good way to go about it is to pay for NHL Gamecenter and a proxy so you can watch games in your region, but I was hoping to find an easier solution that doesn't cost as much, as well as one that would be easy to stream onto a big TV.

Wait For The Drop 7 Compilation Thread! UPDATE: I pushed the deadline back by 5 days to allow everyone more time... And me to get my laptop charger in the mail...I figure its about time we go at this again!For those who dont know, Wait For the Drop is a compilation album featuring songs submitted by producers local to this subreddit. To enter, all that's required is **1** original song (or original remix that has no copyright restrictions i.e. no remixes of TV themes/bootlegs of popular songs). It HAS to be Dubstep and submitted on November 15th 2013 to the subreddit that will be specified around that time (don't post your tracks here!)Also, the final, submitted file will have to be a 16bit 44.1khz .wav file hosted at any downloadable source. Let me know if you have any questions, and get to it!On the 17th or so there will be a thread posted with a link to a subreddit where yall can vote on the top 10-14 tracks to be included on the album. ________________ Brief Rundown______________* HAS TO BE DUBSTEP THE WHOLE WAY. 140bpm, half time, snare on the 3, lots of subbass. If you submit Electro House I will say very mean things to you. * Length does not matter, but keep it reasonable. 2 minutes is a bit short, 8 is really pushing it.* **Do not post your track here. This thread is not for submissions*** Any style of dubstep is fine, deep, dungeon, purple, aggro, whatever* The final submitted file HAS to be a 16bit 44.1khz .wav file. I will convert them down myself. There is ALWAYS someone who just glosses over these and submits a 2 minutes Levels bootleg remix in an mp3. DO NOT BE THAT GUY. 	dubstep	1382319480

Wait For The Drop 7 Track SUBMISSION Thread! Triple Update: Keep sending tracks in. Although I got 21 submissions only 12 people actually submitted dubstep.You have to submit Dubstep. This is /r/dubstep. Do not submit things that are not dubstep to /r/dubstep. In this thread you can submit your track to be potentially featured on our own compilation series: "[Wait For The Drop](http://dubstepit.tumblr.com/)". To submit, **[click this to message your track to this account with a soundcloud link and "Artist - Title"](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=W7TD)** Putting them in the subject is cool, but it just has to be easy to tell whats what.* PLEASE include your artist and title cuz i dont want to scan for what should be obvious information you know?* I also very very very encourage using soundcloud because it embeds in reddit and makes life easier for everyone. Plus its free. After a certain time period, the tracks will be posted to a separate subreddit where they can be voted upon. I think that's really the best we can do as far as deciding which end up on the compilation.The top 12-14 tracks will be accepted, depending on how many are submitted.This topic will remain open until I think I have enough tracks to make voting interesting (probably around 20ish, who knows).[If you don't know wtf this is all about, read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/1ovfeu/wait_for_the_drop_7_compilation_thread/) Ask me any questions you may have, and laugh at the people who skim and post their song here anyway.	dubstep	1384553575

Vote on the tracks you'd like to see on the Wait For the Drop 7 compilation! Details inside! Yup I finally got to a real country w/ real internet and finally wrapped this up.**[Please go to this subreddit and upvote the things you like!](http://www.reddit.com/r/w4td7)**If you do not see your track in there and you are SURE you submitted one it is likely because you did not follow instructions. I specifically asked for 1. FUCKING DUBSTEP (At least 10 people just straight up glossed over everything and submitted some electro house bullshit) and 2. Has to be original or you need have the rights to remix (so no bootlegs, or remixes of popular songs).If you're SURE that I'm just spiting you and that you did everything right, please PM me a link and I'll add it ASAPOtherwise...Please listen and enjoy! Upvote the songs you like, and after there is a clear distinction of what people like I will message the top 12 or so for a .wav of the song and then compile the whole thing. Don't downvote, don't be that guy, everyone hates that guy. I'm only going to look at the upvote score anyway. Let me know if I missed anything 	dubstep	1388891928

S01E07 - Anyone catch the score of the hockey game? Might have been a great detail to the show http://i.imgur.com/OS2hANc.png I thought it had significance because Bill Oswalt (the sheriff guy played by Bob Odenkirk) mentioned that they lost 3 lives in 2 days, and here we have the score being 3 against Minnesota. Also Molly took down 1 of the "visitors" so maybe that's the one goal represented?Might be reaching a bit far here, but that'd be a great detail otherwise! 	FargoTV	1401262327
Should be obvious but EVERY post needs to have Track title - Artist in submission. It's a big deal because it's a good measure of who has read the rules in the sidebar. If you just submit "LOL CHEK DIS SIK TUNE OUT" that shit will be removed because it shows you put no effort into your submission. It's also just helpful to everyone else you know?I also encourage everyone to leave our the lengthy descriptions in your mix submissions. "This is my first ever mix I did in my new apartment after my dog died" is not convincing anyone of anything.A simple "DJ Name - Title of Mix (Ft. -artist name-, -label name-, -artist name-, etc) [DL]" is perfect.Not gonna remove anyones posts for the mix thing, but its just something to keep in mind because I believe it's annoying to people who just want to find something to listen to. 	shallowhouse	1401413895

Join us in IRC Chat + Streaming Radio! As some of you may know, Shallow House was brought into existence in the EMP Radio IRC chat, specifically&gt; &lt;MrLime&gt; I'd call it deep house. It's just... not as deep &gt;&lt;resykle&gt; so like shallow house Anyway, after seeing the topic about interest in a radio station, I thought (after stealing the idea from /u/djscsi ) it would be cool to open up the doors (even wider) to everyone here!------You can join the chat via web by clicking **[here](http://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23electronic&amp;server=irc.emp.cx)** or using your irc client to connect to server: irc.emp.cx channel: #electronicTo tune into the station, you can use the **[Webplayer](http://emp.cx/listen.html)** or opening http://emp.cx/listen.pls in whatever media player you use.--------If you are a DJ and would like to stream a mix, please contact one of the ops with a recent mix of yours and we can help you get set up.EMP isn't *strictly* a house station, so we like to encourage any and all types of music, so long as its electronic. I look forward to seeing some of you!	shallowhouse	1410921100

[Build Ready] Production/Light gaming, where could I cut corners? (~$800) Mainly building as an upgrade from a shitty, 5 year old, half melted Lenovo laptop. Primary purpose will be Audio Production, so CPU/memory are important, but it would also be nice to play skyrim, tf2, Civilization, and hopefully newer titles like GTA V and whatnot. Ideally I would like to cut corners to my build now, but be able to upgrade later if need be. I definitely plan on getting more RAM later, and maybe a better gfx card at some point, so I'm not sure if the motherboard is a good investment or notSSDs seem to be at the top of everyones list so I figure I should board that train as well. I already have Windows/Monitors and whatnot so that's not an issue.

Who is: Distance Following /u/ez_poptarts' wonderful post about Skream, I figured I'd follow up with one about one of my personal favorite producers, Distance! In this post I hope to have an extremely vague paraphrasing of his wikipedia page, but make up for that with a selection of tunes that will show you evolution of the guy as a producer and hopefully introduce his music to people that may have been unaware before. I'm going to aim this to be more of an introduction than a comprehensive guide, so feel free to add your own favorite tunes in the comments and I will add/credit to this "guide" as need be. -----**Distance**-----Like Skream, Greg Sanders is also a British producer and DJ credited with pushing and innovating the sound of Dubstep in its early years. Currently runs the record label [Chestplate](http://www.discogs.com/label/91046-Chestplate) which focuses on the heavier sounds of Dubstep. The label began as a platform to release his own music, but soon grew to promote local artists with similar sounds and has now expanded to included producers from the US as well.In a nutshell, Distance's sound is heavily influenced by Metal music (think Black Sabbath, Slayer) and features synthesizers run through guitar amps. For the most part, if you prefer deeper, UK influenced bass music like the stuff in /r/realdubstep, I'd recommend listening to these earlier tracks.If you like newer, heavier Dubstep ([2009 era Excision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PAaTeRxYk)) You can skip down to 2011 and newer albums. -----**My Demons** [2007] ALBUMOne of two major albums. All really, really dark sounding, Traffic is one of the heavier tracks, and Weigh Down represents the more... calmer? side of things. Definite night-time music, and certainly not happy sounding* Distance - **[Weigh Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZxn0wmU8vw)*** Distance - **[Traffic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUyscDT-n-Y)****Repercussions** [2008] ALBUMSecond album, somehow even darker than the first. Features a lot more obvious metal vibes in tunes like Headstrung and V. Introduction of the LFO wobbles we all know and love /s.* Distance - **[V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEpuq51ncNk)*** Distance - **[No Sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz46RSPDpHI)** (Sick guitar-like melody)Now to the fun stuff.[2010] * Distance - **[1 Regret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNWk4DMZNGI)** - Autonomic 170bpm track, spacey but rather dark. Dark is the word im going to use for every single one of these tracks. Dark dark dark dark dark * Distance - **[Menace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWSXsBGq8vE)** - Yeeeeah this pretty much just screams "metal". Heavy distorted synths and a proper headbanging drum pattern. Must hear for any metal fans[2011]* Distance - **[Meanstreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VZfOmt57I)** - Moving away from the distorted guitars previous, this track features a more complicated, evolving bassline which still maintaining the dissonant synth-strings of previous tracks. Dude loves his minor scales. * **[Meanstreak EP Mini Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJP6B5zSKM)** Whole thing is similar to the title track, so take a listen!* 2011 also saw the release of **[Dubstep Allstars Vol 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZcv2yIYcaY)** featuring a large quantity of tracks from his label, Chestplate, as well as artists like COmmodo, SP:MC, J:Kenzo, The Others, and others. [2013]* Distance - **[Set You Free ft Stepa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYfgfijFEME)** - now we're getting into some serious shit. Production has escalated to modern "everything is clear and loud" levels, lots of great stereo effects, vocals, the whole shebang. This year had a host of other remixes of semi-popular tracks that combined Distnace's heavy signature style with pop tunes.* Paloma Faith - **[Just Be (Distance Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDEMWyh3RAg)*** Alex Clare - **[Too Close (Distance Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xQg_anv-Io)**[2014]* Distance - **[Long Live The Groove](https://soundcloud.com/distance/distance-long-live-the-groove)** - scratch that, NOW we're getting into some serious shit. This is about as new as this list can get. This track features all the bass LFO sound design of the previous decade combined, as well as the dissonant melodies layered on top. Great track that combines the new styles of dungeon dubstep with the percussion of older dubs.For more dark, deep, dangeous bassy goodness check out the **[Chestcast Podcast](http://www.chestplate.co.uk/)** which generally features a mix form the man himself, a new talent section, and a guest mix from Chestplate friends and family.---Thanks for making it this far, and feel free to comment with your favorite tracks and insights! 	dubstep	1416116136
Introducing bi-weekly themes! Theme for 11/20-11/22 = Jazzy Dubstep Based off a thread/post by /u/sweetlobsterbabies, I am implementing a beta version of a themed week. ------------Basically, for the next 2 days, I encourage (and enforce) the submission of **jazzy dubstep tunes**. Things like [Silkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6aBO9d33bA), [Geode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1DQdlRtIgY) and etc are encouraged. Accepting the default 25 link view, let's say 60-70% have to follow this general style. Others will be removed at moderator discretion.------------I welcome any feedback relating to this concept, as it's made possible by subscribers like you! Over the next few days I plan to see how submissions go and whether or not anyone actually cares, and take indications from that whether to extend the dates, change the rules, or abolish the idea altogether. Currently Im thinking about extending this to the whole week but we'll see how things goIf you would like to consult the schedule and see whats in store, please **[look at this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z_HFgYhlIyMPxyQbP1M0OdhMC7rFrSdJ-rhK9JeOyto/edit?usp=sharing)**. This is by no means final, just a visual representation of what the project should look like.You can also vote for themes you'd like to see next **[here](http://goo.gl/forms/qoesNBnSRm)**, just to make sure we cover enough bases. 	dubstep	1416543021

Theme for the week - Tearout Based off a thread/post by /u/sweetlobsterbabies, I am implementing a beta version of a themed week. ------------Basically, for the next 2 days, I encourage (and enforce) the submission of **DIRTY TEAROUT dubstep tunes**. Things like [Coki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cWgvo6TtZQ) [Kromestar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUEgm6Hu9QQ) [Jakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea0RVEB3O-0) and etc are encouraged. I imagine this will cross over a bit to what some of you refer to as "riddim" so that's fine too.Accepting the default 25 link view, let's say 50-60% have to follow this general style.

Battery or Alternator dead? 2003 Ford Escape My car has been kind of sketchy on start (falters a little bit before kicking on) and yesterday it died in the parking lot. I got a jump start but it only lasted until I was out of the parking spot where it sputtered and died again. I think it was when i pressed the gas that it died.It makes weird clicking noises, and the overhead lights flash on/off when I had my key in the 3rd position. Anyone know if this is a completely dead battery or do I have a larger problem here?Update - it was the battery. AAA tested it n hooked it up with a new one. Crisis averted 	MechanicAdvice	1418680515

Dubstep merch? I've been trying to find some dubstep related hats/shirts but am having a really hard time since there isn't like a compiled list of what's available.  Also seems like most labels ship their merch from the UK which heavily brings the price up. Anyone here have some good links to stores or labels? Bonus points if its in the US! 	realdubstep	1422315996

Installing custom recovery/CyanogenMod on Galaxy S4 NB1 In a very foolish move I completely fucked up my phone, and when I flashed back to stock I accidentally used the NB1 firmware instead of MDL (which is what I originally had). I read that you can't install any recovery other than SafeStrap, but I'm hoping there's still something I can do to get Cyanogenmod at least. I was trying to install CM12 but was having issues with flashing Google Play, so I tried going downgrading to update TWRP to 2.8 and that's when everything broke.Right now I'm on 4.4.2 Stock Touchwiz (with root thanks to Towelroot) and I'd love any tips on how I could get back to Cyanogenmod. I'm also on baseband I337UCUFNB1 for AT&amp;Tthank you!!EDIT: Upon more searching I see that you can't install any real ROMs with Safestrap - but since I had MDL before, is there any way to downgrade to that? Or did I reaallly fuck myself here?	AndroidQuestions	1424991119

Enough is enough. Please read. This skism between "real" and "bro" dubstep has gone far enough. After a serious discussion with the crew of /r/realdubstep (and consulting the magic Mere Sher record sleeve), we have decided to end the Tale of Two Subreddits and unify once and for all.We encourage crossposting of all types of Dubstep between the two subs now, be it made by Proxima, Deafblind, Tchami, Zomboy, or Dillinja.For the next week, we particularly encourage posting tracks from the NEW blood of Dubstep. That is, Soundcloud users with less than 50 followers who have been producing for less than 1 year. Lets not let dinosaurs let us decide what is and isn't proper bassweight!Let's again welcome our brethren from /r/realdubstep with open arms and then go forth to show them some PROPER bass!	dubstep	1427891969

Regarding subreddit blackout As you may or may not be aware, there is some reddit drama going on right now. Basically, a reddit employee-type got fired and many people are unhappy with how reddit admins communicate with the community.Here are some sources to get an idea of who cares and whyhttps://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3bymjd/dear_reddit_you_are_starting_to_suck/https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/So some subreddits went private as a show of protest/defiance.We chose not to because honestly who cares. This sub isn't super active and we're just here to share music. But I think it is good for there to be transparency so here's the lowdown on what's going on and how it doesn't really affect us. If you have some strong opinions feel free to air them.Carry on.	dubstep	1435920374

The downvote button I swear every time we remove/put it back we forget why it was exactly that lead us to that action. This time it was like "damn people are downvoting too much shit, lets remove it"now its "damn people arent downvoting ENOUGH shit, why did we take it out?"So what do you think, put it back or leave it out?	dubstep	1441420379

R9 Fury a worthwhile upgrade from R9 290? Hey, hope these sorts of posts are ok. I have a Sapphire R9 290 and while it's pretty great I'd like to get something that can push &gt;60 fps and max out my games (Witcher 3, Far Cry 4, Fallout 4 hopefully). I'm playing at 1080p at the moment, but will hopefully one day upgrade to 1440p w/ freesync so it'd be nice to be ready for that.Been looking at the Sapphire R9 Fury card and wondering if anyone's had experience with that and if the price jump would be worth it, or if it'd be better to just wait. I would consider crossfire but the Vapor-X cooler is so massive that anything below it would smother it. EDIT: Thank you all so much for your responses. I've definitely been talked into the saving money (or cheap crossfire) route, at least until the next line of cards!	Amd	1444617776

Transfer speeds from seedbox to you? kinda new to this but I'm wondering what your average transfer speeds are with SFTP/FTP or BTsync. Right now I have PulsedMedia and my speeds are usually 100 KB/s per connection(I did segmented downloading and it went up to 800). So while it's great watching my files download super quick to the box... it's a little annoying having to wait so long to actually get to them, since I have an 80mbps connection at home.What are other peoples experiences? Do you have good speeds or do you just wait. 	seedboxes	1449019980

Looking for a car under 18K for a very tall person Currently have an 03 Ford Escape which is wonderful but it's draining my wallet with repairs (175,000 miles on it). I love the small SUV life but I don't think I can afford another one since I value MPG and longevity more now.I've been looking at Mazda 6s, Honda Accords, and Ford Fusions/Focuses but wondering if there is anything I missed. It would be amazing to own a Subaru but I can't afford a WRX to make the most out of the brand. For context to the title, I'm 6'4" and looking for something made in the past 3-6 years, looks cool and isn't too bad for maintenance/fuel. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1459194578

Unable to undervolt/overclock Sapphire R9 Fury Status: UnresolvedComputer Type: DesktopGPU: Sapphire R9 Fury NitroCPU: i5 4690k - not overclockedMotherboard: Gigabyte GA-H97-D3hRAM: Adata 8gb x 2PSU: Seasonic 650w PlatinumOperating System &amp; Version: Windows 10  X64GPU Drivers: 16.11.5Chipset Drivers: up to dateBackground Applications: Logitech gaming software, dropbox, discord, splice, steam, hexchat, google drive, unified remoteDescription of Problem: I've been trying to undervolt my Fury as I've seen many people mention better temps/lower power usage and for some reason have not had any success. Whenever I drop it down it runs fine while I'm idling, but when I go to play a game it runs for like an hour then the drivers reboot and the game is frozen.Not sure I'm doing anything wrong other than changing the core voltage in MSI afterburner.Same with overclocking (unrelated to undervolting, Ive changed the voltage back to normal and would increase power limit by like 20%). Whenever I adjust the clock to anything other than stock (even from 1050 to 1060), it runs fine for a bit then suddenly the game crashes, screens go blank and Crimson restarts. Am I just unlucky w/ regards to my cards UV/OC potential or am I doing something utterly wrong? I've followed the usual guides on OCing and it still seems to do this despite no major temp increase (never hit more than 75C)	AMDHelp	1480801493

Worth to upgrade from Haswell i5 (4690k) to Kabylake i7? Hey, i've been looking at benchmarks, and while it seems like there is a moderate performance increase, I am wondering if anyone had a particularly strong opinion or experience.Currently have an R9 Fury, H97 mobo, 16gb of DDR3-1600 RAM, and a Haswell i5 4690k.(Full build - https://pcpartpicker.com/user/resykle/saved/pgJMpg)Since I'm a dumbass, my motherboard can't really overclock at all so I'm debating either swapping that out for a Z97 or making the jump to a 7700k.New motherboard would be like $160, while a whole new system would be around $600, but assuming I can sell for ~$300 that might not be the biggest hit.Any thoughts?	buildapc	1485480854

There is no such thing as a casual game of Frontlines I just got out of a 3 hour game. Even when I lost I felt relieved that 'thank god finally someone got their shit together enough to finishit'. There seriously needs to be a time limit on this gametype. Hell even if calls it a tie by 1 hour that would be good enough. On the plus side, real easy way to do those "get 15 kills in one round" unlocks... I got 110 kills. 	battlefield_one	1489995758
Absurd lighting/weather effects Not sure if its just me, but the lighting bloom and sun lighting is absolutely ridiculous.

Overclocking turbo boost? 7700k Hi, I've been reading this board for a while but haven't found any specific info about this.I'd like to just overclock my 7700ks turbo boost since I don't reaally need it running at 4.8/5ghz the whole time. Is this possible? Everything I've seen has you setting constant voltage and thats what I have been doing in the past but thanks to the 7700ks already high temps I'd rather have it run a bit slower when I'm not gaming for the sake of temperature.I have an MSI Z270 SLI PLUS motherboard if that helps.Thank you!	overclocking	1495217876
Which reading is correct? I've run into an issue where I cant figure out which monitoring software is giving me accurate readings. My MSI Command Center and HW Monitor tell my my CPU is idling at 40C and about 70-80C under load while Speedfan give me a much more optimistic 28C + 60C. eg. http://i.imgur.com/A1RhshY.pngWhich one should I trust?	overclocking	1496078939

LL Fans and Commander Pro Anyone else having issues? I got an RGB Fan hub from corsairs site and 1 LL fan. But when i plug it in it only shows Blue and Green lights in an upper corner and that's it. Does nothing when I attempt to connect to it through Link. I contacted support and they told me to buy a 3 pack which is kind of ridiculous since I only need 1 fan, not 3, and not definitely not for another $100 since I already have a lighting node pro	Corsair	1509316743
2014 Infiniti Q50 Hybrid vs 2015 Lexus GS350 (maybe Fsport) Looking for a sporty sedan under, or around 30K. Narrowed it down to an Infiniti Q50 hybrid which was amazing to drive but had kinda small trunk space and Lexus GS350 which was also fun but had abysmal infotainment. Id love to android auto but I dont mind just using my phone for everything or plugging an old ipod in and using that for music.I was hoping to swing for an AWD version of either of these but idk if my budget will allow for that. But I'm guessing its not too big of a deal. Either way I'm looking for reliability and room as I am 6'4". I am aiming from a '14-'16 version of either of these, hoping you guys have strong opinions about either!	whatcarshouldIbuy	1515382772
Basically a Lexus GS350 (sporty sedan) but with Android Auto/Custom headunit Made a post a while ago about Q50 vs Gs350 and realized both have abysmal tech. Would be fantastic to have android auto or to install a head unit of my own but neither of those have that option. I love both the cars otherwise but wondering if there's an alternative to have my cake and use waze on it tooSize: I'm 6'4" so has to be midsize-large Use: Mostly commute but occasional fun mountain drives Year: Ideally recent (2014-2016), but willing to go back a few years for quality. Budget: roughly 20K-30KTech: leather seats, heated/vented seats would be a plus but not set on it, AWD would be nice but not necessary, blindspot detection also nice Maintenance: Has to be reliable, don't want to sink half my paycheck into fixing it every other month, so that rules out German carsWould love to hear your thoughts!	whatcarshouldIbuy	1515719365
Talk me out of buying a 2015 Hyundai Genesis Made a thread here a while ago about Gs350 vs Genesis and drove both today. Both are fantastic but Genesis takes the cake due to the tech, being slightly cheaper, and me realizing the Sport+ of the lexus is useless if you spend 80% of your time in California traffic. Found a few Genesis's for about 26-28K and its even within my price rangeGenesis has acceptable torque, great tech, cool sound system, and I can install Android Auto.Is there anything I missed? Does anyone have one and absolutely hate it? 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1516485398

On my 3rd PSU in the past week, no idea why they keep dying - please help Hello, this is my current build - https://pcpartpicker.com/user/resykle/saved/wb6CmGA week ago, my 850w Seasonic PRIME Titanium PSU unexpectedly died. Unfortunate but I RMA'd and got an 850w Titanium Ultra PRIME. Again, everything was fine until my PC suddenly shut off and THIS PSU died too!I'm at a complete loss. I had another Prime Titanium PSU that I bought to tide me over until the RMA arrived (was going to sell it off) that I am using right now, but I have no idea what went wrong. I swapped the AC cable and plugged it into a power conditioner I use for my audio gear, but I'm worried this will happen againWhat could cause a PSU to simply stop working? This Seasonic model is supposed to be "the shit", and even has a 12 year warranty to prevent this sort of thing. Could it be my motherboard that is causing issues? The rest of my gear is functioning completely fine and I don't see any abnormalities otherwise.For reference, after the first one died I took it to a Computer shop to test all my components and they ruled the PSU as the problem after using one of theirs to POST my system.	buildapc	1516687009

BIOS disregards boot settings + NVMe takes longer than SATA did Mobo: ASUS Maximus IX CodeSSD: Samsung 950 Evo 500gbFor some reason no matter how short I set my BIOS timeout to be, it does whatever it wants and I get 2 loading screens before Windows finally kicks in. Not sure what I am doing wrong. Everything is updated, all drivers are installed (including samsungs), but my NMVe still takes roughly 28 seconds to boot no matter what settings I change.

Roomy, fun sedan or crossover/SUV from 2015 ~24K? Hi, looking to replace my 2012 ford escape in the coming months. Was originally looking at 2015 Lexus GS350s but unfortunately slightly out of my budget and general uses.I've been looking at Subarus but they don't look that great and don't seem to have that much power. I'd really like something that's fun to drive as well as having utility and tech. Unfortunately most of the WRX/STI wagons are tiny too. I'm 6'4" and thats just no good.24K is hopeful, but if its more I'd save for a higher downpayment if its something that'll bring me joy. I can't lease since i drive more than 1K miles a month. So far I've got2016/2017 Ford Escape - exactly what I have now but slightly better and with android auto2015-2016 Ford Edge - slightly larger but lose AA2015 Lexus RX350 or NX200t - Lexus is cool and will last forever, but premium fuel and shitty infotainment might be a pain2016-2017 Maxda CX5 - mazdas are supposedly fun now?  But definitely breaching that 24K mark.2014 - VW GTI or Audi A3 - apparently these are super fun AND roomy, but i'm tall and im afraid I won't fit into one. Also I cant have a manual here because I sit in traffic constantly. German maintenece scares me, i dont want to be bankrupted by car service Wildcard -   2010 GS350 - screw moving things and going camping entirely and hope I can fit something like a chair into a sedan? 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1522864248
How to get Sonarr to actually MOVE sorted files to a different location? So my setup is on my NAS Sonarr finds a .torrent, sends it up to my seedbox, seedbox does its thing and copies the file to a directory. LFTP sweeps every 5 minutes and moves that file back to my NAS into a folder called /sync/. Is it possible to have Sonarr check THIS folder for the downloaded file then move it to /TV/? I'm having issues with this step 	sonarr	1524707960
Looking for help with Sonarr My current setup is a NAS + Seedbox. I have Sonarr running on my NAS, it scans RSS for a torrent then sends it to my seedbox. Seedbox downloads and copies it to a folder.

Issues with Live 10.0.2 GUI Freezing Anyone else come across this? I have no idea whats causing it. Everything plays fine and then the GUI freezes and becomes nonresponsive. The program still runs and audio plays but I cant affect anything.My system is pretty powerful (7700k @ 5ghz, 32GB DDR4 Ram, 1080ti) so it shouldn't be a lack of resources but I'm running out of ideas as to what could have caused this.I've tried quitting all running programs, disabling overclocks, resetting everything, but no avail. Going to hope for an nvidia/intel/windows/ableton update or something magical to resolve but hoping someone has come across this issue in the meantime 	ableton	1527657794

Go-to Rad fans better than Gentle Typhoons? Hey there, I've been running 1 or 2 darkside 120mm Gentle Typhoons on my rad for a few years now and they've been amazing. However they're starting to make noises and I think it might be time to let them go.I've been having a hard time finding an equivalent. I saw Noctua has new fans out but before I make my rig an eyesore, does anyone have any recommendations?The [EK-Vardar EVO 120ER RGB](https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-vardar-evo-120er-rgb-500-2200-rpm#ow_alert_box) looks really nice and RGB would be a nice touch. I tried running the new corsair fans (ML120 pro, LL120) but they didn't match the performance of the GTs so I ended up returning them. 	watercooling	1528862836

Loved G37 but it's too small for me. Any other suggestions? Any thoughts on ~2010 GS350? Hi as the title said I went to test drive a G37 after selling myself on it via this subreddit, but unfortunately it's just a taaaadd too small for me. I'm 6'4" so its super hard to find a car where i dont have to back the seat all the way up.I've been looking at older GS350s and they look good (slightly roomier) but they're all very high mileage. I'm guessing there's nothing wrong with buying a lexus that has 80K - 100K miles on it already? I plan on driving it rather spiritedly at times.Otherwise I like the looks of the Infiniti FX35s but there are seemingly none in my area that are around 18K or with less than 100K miles on the odo.Any ideas?Want: Sedan/sporty crossover with room for a 6'4" personBudget: Around 18K, preferably lower. Location: bay area, californiaI do not want a german car because it would cost too much to maintain at this price point. I'm not super excited about american brands either. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1529803609
The internet used to be better when we had 50 different forums instead of a unified site like reddit. I really like reddit because its easy to use, its great to discover new content, but lately it's been harder to get away from toxicity. I'm in a bunch of PC gaming related subreddits and once in a while i see a shit-flinging political argument form and think 'how the fuck did this get here?'and more importantly, how do i steer clear of the whole mess. It's not enough to just ignore it because it still exists and purveys itself. With the 50 different forums, it was much easier to moderate and just remove/ban people who were causing trouble. If you were spewing openly racist shit on a music production forum you would get banned really quick and the problem was solved and everyone got back to topic.Can't do that on reddit because there aren't nearly enough dedicated moderators to banhammer toxic elements, and the admins refuse to take a concrete stand on what is and isn't ok because they "want everyone to be involved". You can block a user but there's little stopping them from either making another account, or for someone else to eventually come across that thread. In the meantime, I've been making great use of RES's filter feature. 	self	1529960442
2009-2012 Infiniti FX35/37 vs 2015 Subaru Forester XT got loads of great suggestions from this sub but after test driving some options ive narrowed down my options after comparing needs vs wants.To preface, I drive a 2012 Ford Escape right now so my definition of "fun" has some seriously low standards. It has a V6 so 250hp/220lb torque is perfectly adequate but the transmission is ass so almost anything is an upgrade. I'd like to keep either car for 5-6 years so it'll be a long term relationship for sure. I don't want to drive stick since I sit in traffic a LOT (Bay area, california)**Forester XT Pros** -get invited to the Subaru partiesloads of aftermarket things to install if I ever get boredLOADS of space, easy to upgrade head unit, Eyesight, etc**Forester Cons**CVT gets lots of complaints from others, but probably won't matter given my non-manual predispositionsWould have to opt for Touring trim to get the best features, which adds a lot of $$ to price**Infiniti FX35 or 37 Pros**300hp!Seats are comfier than the subaru**Infiniti Cons**Kinda pricey for a 5+ year old car, surprisingly hard to find in my area Most around me are in the 70k-100k mile range which makes me nervous about longevityTrunk is smaller than the subaru, not AWD but that doesn't bother me too much**Wildcard**2015 GTI?Pros - holy shit its fun, get invited to the GTI parties, also loads of aftermarketCons - Might also potentially bankrupt me2016 CX-5?Pros - very fun, nice interior, can be hacked to have android auto, basically a straight upgrade from my current rideCons - 185hp :\ 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1531095345

Making a 2012 3.0L more fun? Hey, I have a 2012 Escape XLT V6 and am wondering if anyones done any mods to make the transmission more responsive or anything else to make the ride more interesting? No major problems with mine, just feels like the shifting lags when I'm trying to pass on the highway. I step on the gas and it takes like 1/2 a second for it to jump into high RPMs which is annoying when I'm trying to accomplish delicate maneuvering. On my previous '03 I got a new muffler and air intake (mostly just to try to extract what I could from an older car) and that seemed to help a bit with the "fun sounding" aspect at least.Any thoughts from other owners?	fordescape	1531194031

Stellaris I like games like Civ 5/6 a lot but honestly that's only because I had already invested the time in learning them. Is stellaris easy enough to pick up where I won't spend 5 hours just figuring out wtf I'm supposed to accomplish (looking at you, Crusader Kings 2).I'm looking for something I can casually hop into once in a while and build a city/civlization/space race/whatever while watching Seinfeld. Maybe not SUPER casual but at least slightly forgiving and long-term.I already have and love: Cities Skyline, Civ 5/6, FTL, Factorio, Rimworld, and Kerbal Space Program (Although definitely no idea what i'm doing in that one either)	ShouldIbuythisgame	1531282118

Anything I've missed? Mostly set on a 2017 Mazda 6 Touring - any alternatives? Bad idea to buy a rental? My current car has annoyingly expensive repairs/maintanence coming up and I'd rather avoid the whole fiasco by getting something properly japanese.A load of 2017 Mazda 6's have appeared near me and I'm hoping to trade my car in and get one. I've test driven a 2018 and a 2016 and liked them enough to be swayed.This is a particular model I'm interested in - https://www.truecar.com/used-cars-for-sale/listing/JM1GL1V58H1110199/2017-mazda-mazda6/?zipcode=95051I've also looked at 2012 Acura TLs and 2014 Honda Accords (V6) but the 'newness' of the Mazda is compelling me, plus I enjoyed driving it a lot even with the diminished horsepower.Anything else I've missed? I feel more compelled by Acura than Honda, and Honda more than Toyota. I'll test drive an Accord before making a final decision but so far the Mazda 6 is in my sights.Are there any problems with buying a rental too? It has 40K miles which is a bit daunting but I'm guessing most of that is freeway and it's been well maintained? Or is this a terrible mistake.I am also rly tall (6'4") so almost all compacts are out of the picture otherwise I'd be in a G37 already. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1534465894
Divinity:Original Sin 2 or Dragons Age Origins? I'm fairly inexperienced w/ straight RPGs like these two, I think the most "RPG" game I've played recently was Witcher 3. Normally I play FPS games but I've found myself with a lot of time on my hands so I wanna check one of these two out.I've heard immensely good things about both but which would be easier to get into? Or which has less tedious quests. I really liked Skyrim but always got frustrated with an infinite amount of GO TO X TO GET Y quests that weren't that fun. Heavy preference on which game 'looks' good too. I have an OC'd 7700k + 1080ti and i like putting them to work. I know absolutely nothing about the two games other than there's prob dragon and magic type shit involved. I usually prefer sci-fi settings but hey if its good its good.

Yet another Q50 vs G37/Q40 post - Maintenance costs? hey guys, currently planning to make one of these my next ride but would love some insight.Between the 2015 Q50 and 2013/2015 G37/Q40 are there any big differences in maintenence costs? I'm torn between the two - Q50 for the looks and features and G37 for the nice engine noises and simplicity (personally prefer buttons to touchscreen, but Q50 has lots of neat features the G doesn't)Other than sheer upfront costs and the Q50 being a tiny bit larger (i'm 6'4"), are there any big discrepancies in costs as far as parts and labor? I know the Q probably has more things that could need replacing, but the two seemed mostly similar when I checked parts on rockauto - is this true in real world applications?Anyone have really strong feelings towards one or the other? I'm planning on buying sometime in November and am assuming it'll be easier to score a deal on a Q50 since it's newer - plus I just think it looks better!Thank you!	infiniti	1536978637

Game dropped all my spells - any way to get Bless back? Not sure if its a spoiler, but I lost my Bless skill because the game dropped alll my skills/spells from my characters somehow. I've done ok but now one of my dudes is petrified and I cannot un-petrify him.are there any hijinks or mod I can use to get my Bless spell back to fix this? I think I need it to for other quest-critical things as well since it's been hard to get by without it.	DivinityOriginalSin	1537495006

1809 Network Issues? Hey, just updated to 1809 and everything is great except I am having a really odd problem with an IRC client and my ubiquiti AP. IRC client has no problems ending or receiving system messages but cannot see ANYTHING other users are saying. Has no problem's with other clients but Adiirc specifically started doing this.My Ubiquiti AP also started reading that it's disconnected, even though it is actually working fine.So my question is did this update do anything specific to networks that could have caused this? And how to undo it?Thanks!	windows	1538715400

Every notification vibrates phone regardless of App Setting - anyone else have this issue? As title suggests, every time I get a facebook messenger notification or whatever else my phone vibrates even though I have 'Vibrate' unchecked under that specific notification. It's driving me nuts since its super annoying and I don't want to outright mute/silence the phone or app. I don't THINK I have any weird app controlling notifications... but has anyone come across this issue?

Very interested in a 2015 Lexus GS 350 - anything else I missed? Hello, I am looking to buy a new(er) car in the coming months, wondering if there is anything I missed besides the GS 350. I posted a while ago but my financial situation changed so I'm back to it. Need: Sedan/Wagon. 4 doors. Automatic. Reliable. Fun enough but also comfy. I am coming from a Ford Escape so my standards for fun are very low. I would like a wagon but I'm 6'4" and will not fit in a subaru impreza. Plus im only driving myself around 90% of the time anyway. Car should be roomy but not enormous, GTI just feels too small for me and a Taurus SHO is too big to find comfortable parking. Engine: V6 (or more!), no CVT transmission either. I do like engine/exhaust noises but this can easily be accomplished with aftermarket parts. My price range is roughly 25KThis car will primarily be used for commuting and daily drivingFeatures: Auto cruise control would be nice but not required. Cars I looked at: 2015 Genesis - nice but not as fun as the GS350. Plus not sure how it would hold up over 4+ years. Does have a v8 though but I hear its more 'smooth' than 'vrooom'2015 Q50 - Also nice but feels quite a bit smaller than GS350. Will test drive one again though just to see if I can get used to it since they're quite a bit cheaper. BMW 335i? - I suppose I could lease one but I don't know anything about leasing. This subreddit has scared me from BMW maintenance anywayAudi A4 - same as above, really don't know anything about it either way. I think I would like to avoid Turbo 4cyl engines anyway.GTI - as mentioned above, I like it and even though I fit into one it just feels too small of a car otherwise. Ford Fusion Sport - just not interested in another FordIs the GS350 the perfect choice? My gut is telling me it's the one since it's a lexus so its reliable and resale is good, it was fun to drive and although the infotainment sucks I use my phone for nav almost always anyway. I like how it looks and with some roof racks (is that blasphemy?) I can overcome the downgrade in storage from an SUV... not like I used it more than twice a year. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1544139008

Mark Levinson vs Aftermarket system? (2015 GS 350) Hi there, I'm trying to choose between a 2016 GS 350 or a 2015 GS 350 to buy in the coming months. My budget either allows for a 2016 with the safety goodies (auto cruise control, lane keep assist etc) or an optioned out 2015 with Mark Levinson + FSport.Just how good is the Mark Levinson system? I don't have any issues with adding aftermarket speakers/amps/subwoofers myself (or getting a shop to do it) but the overall cost would definitely be more than just getting the ML and dealing without the auto cruise control features. I won't be sitting in super heavy traffic so it's not a deal breaker on its own... just nice to haveSo all things being equal, do you think an ML system would be just as good as a decent ($800+) aftermarket install? Or is the stock system good enough to use until I decide to upgrade it while making use of all the cool features on the 2016 model.	Lexus	1546911142

2015 Infiniti Q50 Hybrid vs 2015 Lexus GS350 Fsport I swear at this point i just keep making threads to talk about cars... but I'm going to pull the trigger on one of these two in the next few months.I know they aren't technically in the same segment, but they're both in my price range and very similar in interior size (i do not like the Q70 and I cannot fit into an IS series, I am 6'4" and 210lb so 'fit' is very important)Q50S (or hybrid, whatever) Pros Better tech, surround camera is pretty cool, driving aidsCheaper (somehow 2015 are like 24K in my area)The Hybrid actually gets alright gas mileage at the cost of a tiny trunkGS 350 FSport ProsCooled seatsIt's a lexus so will last forever and resale will be great Mark Levinson system is apparently the best in the businessIt's a lexus? Honestly the two are incredibly similar and I'd love some thoughts on Infiniti vs Lexus from this community. The only downside of both cars is the lack of interior storage compartments and the Lexus has a worse infotainment. But honestly I don't really care about that since i'll be using my phone for everything.I'm really lost here, I like the styling of both, both have basically the same power delivery... basically the same interior dimensions (according to KBB anyway)I am NOT considering other options. For my own sake please, I can't think about any more cars.	whatcarshouldIbuy	1551583669

Set on a 2015 GS 350 - please help me decide if I should get FSport or not As title suggests, I'm hoping to pick one of these up in the coming weeks. I'm still not sure if I want an Fsport however. My budget is roughly 26K and while I found a few FSports in that range, they are around 50K+ miles.The pros of non-fsport to me are* cheaper tires* cheaper brakes* softer suspension is actually a plus* way lower mileage for the price, actually gives me the ability to tint + mess with the car in other ways since i'd have more money to do so. Fsport is mostly suspension + appearance anyway.I found a non-fsport with something like 30K miles well within my budget.Pros of Fsport are* firmer ride* better seating adjustments (i'm 6'4", i might need it)* looks way better!* I might regret not getting one and it'd fuck with me foreverI found an Fsport with 56K miles that's within my budgetThe prospect of NOT spending $1K on tires and $1K on brakes every 30K miles is very appealing, but man I just feel like i'd be missing out? The Mark Levinson system is appealing but it is not a selling point to me. Either car is gonna be a massive upgrade for me. But I'd love some thoughts from people here.tl;dr - is Fsport worth $3-4K more + higher mileage? Or just go with premium package + blindspot and be happy?	Lexus	1555790330

GS 350 making 'whining' noise on acceleration - timing belt? The noise gets higher pitched as I rev, might be timing belt? If so - is this any cause for concern?

Considering an OC'd 9900K upgrade - which motherboards are best and does RAM matter? ###Build Help/Ready:**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?

Just how vital is RAM for a 3900x? Hi guys hope this is a good place to post. I am thinking of upgrading from my OC'd/Delidded 7700k to a 3900x in the next few months. However I am concerned that I don't understand the importance of RAM with the new AMD CPUs.My current ram is 32GB (8 x 4) of Corsair Vengeance LPX running at 16-18-18-36 @ 3333mhz. I keep reading that getting good RAM will help a lot with making the most of an AMD processor but I'm wary of spending $250 on top of whats a large expenditure. Is this gonna be fine? I do mostly gaming + audio production, so would like to get the most of my setup, but is the importance of RAM just highlighted because its something for enthusiasts to tinker with or is it actually something that will limit me (GPU is a 1080ti, on a 1440p/165hz monitor)Note - I don't really 'need' a 3900x but i like getting whatever is 'the shit' at the time that'll last me 3-4+ years.

My current plan is to1. Copy 6TB of data to 1 drive2. yank it out3. factory reset everything, set up a new volume as it should have been, or otherwise kill the other 3 drives.4. put 1 drive w data back in, copy everything back, restore settings. Is that the only way to do this? Basically 2 drives were created on the DS216play and 2 were added later on the DS918+.	synology	1578455755

I think you're worrying about it too much.Dubstep isn't going anywhere for a while. There are so many different sounds to be achieved and so many artists there to find them that I don't think it will be getting old any time soon. Look at Mt Eden, distance, and artists like RSD. They're still cranking out new tunes and it all sounds fresh and original.Of course there's going to be a large chunk of dubstep thats WHOMP WHOMP WHOMP WAAAAAAAA WWURRRRRRRRRR WHOMP WHOMP, but that is true for all music.Personally I thought dubstep was a joke at first, I only started listening/mixing/attempting to produce it because I thought it was going to get big in 2010. But it's grown on me since then and I've started to appreciate it.tl;dr: it's not dying, it's just changing	dubstep	1264833186

I'd like to first say that I am in no way opposed to same sex couples. I have no problems with the gay community unless they are being obnoxious about it (i.e. Bruno), but this applies to everyone.Now first, I'd like for you to define what marriage is. It is basically a contract that legally and "spiritually" binds two people for life. Can we agree on this?Now, there is ALREADY a way for the first to happen! Anyone can get a civil union, which is, in effect, the same thing as marriage except without the church. The argument is that a civil union is "seperate but equal", although it does provide every benefit a married couple has minus the ceremony.Now about the ceremony. To be married you have to get married by a priest/some member of a church (i don't know the full details). Why would it make sense for the state to force the church to marry same sex couples? Aren't supposed to be all above the separation of church and state? The two should never be intertwined, especially in this matter.My argument is that there doesn't even have to be a law to force same sex marriage to be legal! It's not needed! Why do people want one then? Simple. Black people and women were both oppressed and discriminated against until they both pushed for laws to be passed to be deemed equal. Now people think that we need laws to be passed (such as this) to integrate same-sex couples into society as well. This is not true however, as there is no discrimination against same sex couples as they cannot be distinguished from other people. A woman can do nothing about being perceived as a woman, for example. I'd love for someone to point out flaws in my argument, and to carry on this conversation as I'm probably going to end up typing a 6 page essay on it later.I also apologize for any structural errors in my argument, im multitasking at the moment and i was more concerned with getting my thought out than its form. Please tell me if you need anything clarified	AskReddit	1267430789

Of course it's not all wobble and womp just as not all rock music is straight powerchords.

I believe that, at least biologically, males and females are programmed to copulate and raise a family. Two males would obviously not feel the same need, meaning they would not be as "attached" to one another, as they could simply leave each other. If we also accept that males are generally more promiscuous than women to begin with, then they would be much more sexually inclined, as you would be able to see if you took a look at much of gay culture.I don't claim to be an expert on this subject (gay marriage). I obviously don't go out campaigning against it. But I do wish people would look at both sides more clearly, not just "ZOMG THEY WANT TO HATE ONT HE GAYS! ITS JUST LIKE RACISM! YOURE A BIGOT!"There's clearly more to the issue here, and it would be unwise to dismiss it. 	IAmA	1272148594

Sweet, down votes for disagreeing on a popular issue! Now, interracial marriages are not. They are NOT THE SAME as same-sex marriages! I don't understand why you would bring that up. For one, we do not discriminate against gays at all! I'm commenting on same-sex marriages not because I think they are unequal, but because I believe they are detrimental. Not "oh gays suck lets not let them marry" more like "this may have detrimental effects to our society, we should think it through"For one, discrimination based on ethnicity is stupid, because black males are the same as white males. Now, if you reverse gender roles, such as having 2 men in a marriage where for as long as we know it has been a woman and a man, that is a very different change.It does not harm me. I'm not saying it does. I don't care if same-sex couples are... well.. same sex couples. They can apply for a domestic partnership if they want, I don't care. I'm saying if we allow same-sex marriage to take place throughout the United States, EVENTUALLY there may be consequences to our society that would be seen as negative, such as marriage no longer having any meaning than "domestic partnership with a ring"Of course, NOBODY has the power to know what the future will bring, I'm simply arguing for an unpopular viewpoint right now.	IAmA	1272151091
What evidence do you have then, that supports the claim that gays are capable of loving each other? And I never said that "I hate gays, they cannot love each other, they should not be allowed to marry"My hypothesis is that because of our current societal structure, we should maintain that marriage should be between a man and a woman as they are biologically programmed to copulate and raise a family, and that it would be beneficial to us to maintain this status. Someone is going to bring up racism and interracial couples up again. Don't do that, as that is an entirely unrelated issue.	IAmA	1272151416
I see your point, but I think that same sex marriage is vastly different than interracial marriage because the difference here is also biological, not just ideological.Gender role I would say is for parenting, as well as establishing a cultural norm.The consequences I see may follow a slippery-slope argument, but it is a possibility nonetheless. If gay marriage becomes legal and widely accepted, more and more men/women would swap heterosexual relationships for homosexual relationships, if only for sexual release or their accessibility. This would dramatically change our culture as well as cause a heavy blow to the already withering institution of marriage. I believe that marriage should be mainly for the purpose of starting a family and raising offspring. If marriage ceases to have that meaning, then what is the point of it? Divorce rates and marriage rates would go through the roof, and the whole point of marriage would vanish.I think it's a little funny that you bring up the example of 2 same sex individuals wanting to marry and being christian (as religion is basically opposed to the idea of homosexuality). But why do you need marriage for them to express their love? Does marriage validate love now?I want to ask you now, Gay marriage is legal, everyone can have a relationship with anyone they could possibly want. Do you think that this would be an improvement to our society? What do you think the next step would be then?	IAmA	1272152203
ooh that's a good one. No I suppose we cannot discriminate based on procreation. But there are already legal benefits without the marriage. You can get a domestic partnership (i think thats what its called), that gives a couple all the legal benefits of marriage. upvoted for solid points	IAmA	1272153063
I have no strong religious background, I used to be a Russian Orthodox but after I moved to the US i lost interest and now declare myself agnostic.I did not know that Canada has same-sex marriage legal. If there has been no notable change then I suppose time will tell.I live in California, in the Bay Area (near San Francisco), so as you can imagine there was a lot of strong support for gay marriage to be recognized. But many of the reasons were obnoxiously bad, such as comparing it to the civil rights movement, and saying that gays were discriminated against. We already have domestic partnerships available, which are basically an exact replica of the benefits of marriage without the marriage part, so to me, why bother legalizing gay marriage? Why not keep that an institution reserved for the nuclear family?I am saying that procreation is just a strong reason behind marriage, not the driving force. And to me it appears that many homosexual couples are together just for the sexual release, and it seems wrong to me that that would be a basis for marriage, which used to be a sacred and well establish institution, but has since lost all meaning.My argument won't really have an impact (plus I am kind of playing devils advocate, in spite of the karma lost). Same sex marriage will eventually be recognized and then we'll see if it was for the better or for worse. 	IAmA	1272153676

would it be a cop-out to say I see and understand your points and believe that my points are more based on me trying to find reason for innately thinking that gay marriage would simply further promiscuity in society, something that I believe is going to badly reflect on our culture?Possibly, but I do see your points, and i cannot argue against them without resorting to argumentative fallacies, so good on you!

Here's an example of something I've gone through first hand.My parents got our greencard and we moved to the United States when I was 8 (Pretty sure it was 1999). I've been living here for the past 10 years or so.Now the russian government is sending policemen to my grandmothers residence (where I used to be registered to be an occupant since I spent my childhood there) at 8am to demand for me to show up for the Russian draft. No matter how many times we tell them that I don't live there anymore, they still show up, at 8am, with invoices demanding me to show up. In fact, now they're threatening to send her to prison for "harboring a criminal" because I'm "Evading mandatory military duty"Only way to get rid of this issue is to resign myself from the apartment. But I can't do that because I'd have to go back to Russia, where I have an expired passport and where I'd be sent off to the military as soon as I stepped foot there.So now we have to go to the Russian embassy in San Francisco (read: hells waiting room), get all of my "paperwork" straightened out, reapply for a passport, and hope there isn't another bureaucratical loophole into which we'll fall 	IAmA	1272438608

I understand your argument, but I believe that if we turn the government into a bigger drug dealer that it would not solve the problem of the "Crack epidemic".Rehabilitation for addicts is of course the right decision, rather than just imprisonment, but there should be heavy penalties on distributing the drug.As for the drug war, we've seen that moderated marijuana usage (of course, any substance is harmful if abused) is not harmful, which is why it is so popular. So if it is legalized then there would be a very small market available for drug dealers to make money in, namely those doing the harder, more addictive drugs (cocaine, heroin, meth), which would be possible to stomp out.but im willing to hear more from your side of the discussion as well	IAmA	1274063461

Very true, but I'd be willing to bet 90% of the "I'm depressed" reddit posts aren't suffering from clinical depression. In fact only about 5% of people in the US are affected by psychological depression (as in, clinically proven), and I severely doubt all of them are on reddit.	AskReddit	1274748096
Absolutely. The fact that most of us are on reddit and reading this means we really don't have huge, life threatening issues to worry about. Live your life with the hope that tomorrow will be a better day.

I feel like they need it more.

Different people have different tastes is all.

No, stuff YOU think is made with craft and skill in mind. I'm sure nit grit and excision approach their songs with as much passion as burial, 2562, or whatever you want to call "good dubstep". Sorry I'm being an ass about this, but it angers me when people dismiss a form of music (particularly one I enjoy) just because it's different than what they are accustomed to. I don't know if you produce yourself or not, but if you do, then surely you must understand the complexity that must go onto any song and still make it sound original and appealing	dubstep	1280262934

&gt;Are you also sick of all the "republicans are crap! don't believe that bullshit!" posts? I don't think religion should get preferential treatment over any other controversial issue on Reddit. And where there is controversy, there is strong wording.I am actually, I think republicans are people too with a different outlook on the world and if we all worked together we could reach a compromise that would make everyone happy. Unfortunately, the internet being what it is allows people to spout whatever they want without repercussions (oh no a downvote!)If you want to link something from Dawkins that you think would be informative please do. All I see from him is the shit the militant atheists spam.&gt;Unfortunately, religion (at least organized religion) too often gets in the way of our lives (e.g. gay marriage, abortions, slowing scientific progress). Religion is also used as justification and a recruitment tool of terrorists.This is true, but that does not mean that ALL of religion is bad. I have friends that are part of a protestant church and they are the nicest people I've ever met who contribute a lot to the community. Yes they most likely voted Yes on 8, but I don't think less of them for that. 	self	1281075998

Hate to say it but welcome to the schism.Dubstep is more or less now divided by those pushing for a new direction and those criticizing where it has ended up.Sadly the two are mostly exclusive. So what do you like? Music that makes you want to drive 80mph with the bass cranked up, or drink tea and stare at a sunset? Either way, I recommend Distance (although if you thought Burial was dark, he might give you nightmares), Torqux &amp; Twist (really filthy, dirty stuff, but very well produced), Numbernin6 (as good of a medium between dubstep and trance as you can get IMO), and Nero (uh.. he's Nero)	dubstep	1282880862

I dabble in producing and mixing dubstep, so I'll answer your questions from my personal experiences   &gt;   Very briefly, what process do the producers have to go through to get these tracks finished? I am assuming this isn't all being written out on paper, but I really don't know how you guys start this process.   Depends. Sometimes you'll have a great idea for a beat and you can write that out, other times I'm just dicking around in Ableton trying to come up with a 4 bar loop that sounds good, and just build around that     &gt; What instrument/tool/software do you find most helps you make the tracks you do?Ableton Live is awesome, I love using Massive as well because it's perfect for creating leads and basslines Oh and Winamp. I have an extensive library of music that I listen to, so sometimes I'd just be skipping around and i'd hear a sound that sounds like it has potential, so I'd rip it from the song and fuck around with it until it becomes something completely different. That's how I came up with my name actually, I figured I was just recycling music :P    &gt;Dubstep isn't what I would call a conventional music scene. How do the lesser known producers get their work out there and how difficult is this process? Does it kind of revolve around how strong a local scene is or does the internet really act as a sole catalyst?You have to do everything. Locally, on the internet, everywhere. I like to believe that if you have talent and are bringing something new to the music, then there will be *someone* out there who will listen to you, perhaps even help you on your way.	dubstep	1283470977

Reddit isn't very good at looking both sides of an issue. It also generalizes like a mofo. See "Religion is bad!" "Pot should be legal!" "Fuck the police!" "The media is brainwashing us!"There are rarely any absolute truths, so people have to find a viewpoint or a side to take.

Whenever I want to create a mix i just make a folder with a bunch of tracks that I feel will fit the style/feel that I want to convey. i.e. If i'm trying to put together a mellow dubstep mix, I'll have a folder with something like 100 tracks that I feel would work well together in a set. Then I just start mixing with whatever works. It helps because when I play out I usually remember what set would work where so I can just dip in and out of folders. 	dubstep	1286673102

No, you can't call something "bad music" simply because you don't like it.

That entire thread just made me go into a murderous rage.After murdering a few small babies I was finally able to calm down... You can't say "All dubstep sucks" unless you have listened to every single dubstep song in the history of the world. And even then it's only a subjective opinion. Someone out there wrote that piece of music and put a little bit of themselves in it, and here some d-bag listens to it for 10 seconds and goes "lol all dis sux". Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's automatically bad. Sure you might think that "real" dubstep is Joy Orbison and Burial but that doesn't mean that you can talk trash about Excision and Downlink. my background: I mix and produce dubstep. I have Burial and that Datsik remix of the Lil Jon song in the same playlist. I wish we could all just agree that we'll have different tastes and that in the end, nobody will be right. 	dubstep	1287264933

For some bangers, see Excision/Datsik/Nero (nero has a lot of remixes that should go over well). For less heavy stuff, look up Caspas remixes (the one of that Kid Sister song is sick and should be good).Honestly, I'm sure there are a lot of overlaps between what you mix and dubstep. I'd also recommend looking into some fidget like Mightyfools, Sound of Stereo, LA Riots, B. Rich, which is basically dubstep but at 130 in full time. 	dubstep	1287539410

for starters, i wasn't patronizing you, i was merely pointing out an observation in this topic since it seems that people are saying that Filthy dubstep tends to originate from the US.Secondly, please don't bring up this "true sound of dubstep" argument. It's all dubstep, even if you don't like it. Also Flux and Borgore play in the UK just as often as here, only difference is due to distance and population.	dubstep	1290136675
dude that was the most over-generalized thing i've ever read here I live in California and what is this ""American" consists heavily of teenagers downloading low quality YouTube rips of songs so they can listen to them on their laptop speakers." bullshit? Are you trolling?Guess what, we still go see the DJs and artists we like, and actually take the time to find new artists and listen to them. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it "inferior". I'm a DJ/Producer and while I like the softer side of dubstep that you mentioned (I actually frequently play DMZ and stuff from Soul Jazz on my colleges radio station), i love mixing up the heavy filthy from Rottun and driving around with Triage/SPL destroying my car sound system.There are tons of artists that have both the midrange AND the bass AND a groove to it. Obviously if you stick to this subreddit you won't hear a lot of the stuff you like, but it's definitely out there.Sorry for the rant, but overgeneralizations really piss me off.

I'm well aware that the UK has heavy stuff, and I also love me some Distance.I disagree with your point that it is not dubstep and that it is a problem. Here's some [Triage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6LYnjrU2YQ). Heavy? Yes. Robot sounds? Yup. Still dubstep. [Ultrablack - Bear Trap (Excision Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0WlXcQ-hmI&amp;feature=related). How is this not dubstep? Even more so, how has it lost anything that was special to dubstep? It became much more technical and the sound has changed a lot, that's all I can see. I'm glad there is more shit like this out rather than endless repeats of Midnight Request Line, because that would be boring as hell. Hyperdub is great studying music or if you want to fall asleep, but not so great if you're trying to wake up in the morning or piss off your neighbors.Maybe the kids around you are the tards that thought O.M.G. was a good album or that deadmau5 makes good dubstep, but those are the same people that actively listened to Soulja Boi and Lil Wayne. That being said, I respect your opinion to listen solely to FG or Hyperdub, but don't be saying that the US is somehow inferior 	dubstep	1290145639

well i mean, you could look at all the posts of people complaining that girls never talk to them, or how "forever alone" they are. IAMA seems to have a contest every few months for "how long i spend inside my house". With that kind of atmosphere around, it's pretty easy to assume that a lot of people are just bitter and need to take their rage out somewhere.i.e. damn neckbeardsThere's an /r/AskAGirl for crying out loud 	AskReddit	1291181976
Sure it's friendly, but you should have seen it around the time of Prop 19 going on in California... Every damn post was about how "californias are stupid and hate freedom if they don't vote yes" (paraphrase :P).You know what? I didn't vote, but if I had it would definitely had been a No. P19 was horrifically worded and would have been a tremendous step backwards. Weed is already legal here anyways, all you need is a "back ache" or "sleeplessness" and $70. EDIT: "lol i luv weed! y u no vote on prop 19! DOWNVOTE" You could always, you know, ASK me why I think this and respect opposing viewpoints. Especially because I actually LIVE in california http://votetaxcannabis2010.blogspot.com/	AskReddit	1291191974
After seeing tons of "forever alone" posts and people bitching about women in various subreddits (most dancing around the fact "why dont chicks like me when I don't make any effort to talk to them"), I was lead to this conclusion.

Exactly. He's electro at best. DEFINITELY NOT DUBSTEP. Excision is dubstep. Rusko is dubstep. Skream, Kode 9 and Scuba are dubstep. 130bpm electro stabs are not dubstep...	dubstep	1291234288
No, most of his stuff is predominantly at 130bpm (or in that range). That and the lack of a subbass puts him into Electro or Breaks. He's not much different than Receptor or Shakes. 	dubstep	1291234360

Ok, attach "legal" to it, and then be able to bust anyone for possession within a 3 block radius of a minor. Because that's what it says! I don't want some half assed document with the word "legal" on it. If there is going to be legalization, it needs to concentrate on the financial benefits of weed.I'm too lazy to search for proper sources, but please at least SKIM this: http://votetaxcannabis2010.blogspot.com/Or leave it essentially decriminalized (the fine is $100. Seriously) and keep it pathetically easy to get a medicinal card. I don't see a problem... We won't reach Amsterdam level legalization, and I don't see why it really matters. Somehow everyone thought that if P19 passed, they'd be able to roll a blunt in front of 7/11, smoke it in front of a cop, and then tell their parents about it.If the country wants less stereotypes about weed, maybe stoners need to be less stereotypical.

I know there is a lot of really stupid shit out there, but that doesn't mean there isn't good stuff too. Also, Dubstep is not slowed down DnB because DnB is generally full-time and Dubstep is half time, with usually programmed beats rather than sampled ones. Although the production for basslines is similar and a lot of DnB artists make Dubstep and vise versa (Nero, Chase &amp; Status, Liquid Stranger now)	DnB	1291412568

So what's the deal with airline food?!	AskReddit	1293866414
id argue they came from UK Garage. Dubstep was at first primarily based around the subbass sound and 2 step pattern (Soul Jazz records, etc), and then recently this new blend with electo happened (see skrillex, deadmau5 fucking things up)Point is that dubstep is about the bass. If I wanted electro, i'd head over to /r/electronicmusic, where most of the shit like Skrillex/Feed Me should be. I go here to listen to music that makes my walls shake and my car windows rattle, not this ADD, generic production.I like the song a lot by the way. This is what dubstep is and should be. Fucking bass waking your neighbors up 	dubstep	1293871032

Heh, can of worms indeed. Personally I think its close enough to dubstep that it fits. I guess Rusko and the Propa Tingz remix are the closest i got to "brostep" in my post, but I see no reason why they aren't also dubstep. They have all the other qualities, in fact most "brostep" songs still have bass... just that you can also listen to it on laptop speakers and not miss out.Personally i don't like the term brostep because it feels like a derogatory term though	dubstep	1293923924

indeed, but all ive seen here from him is his electro. 	dubstep	1293930000
It's not really a unique blend of either. It's just electro. If you listen to other elector artists like Far Too Loud you'll that they're not doing anything particularly new, it's just they somehow got labeled under dubstep.It's as vast a difference as DnB and dubstep. But if I started posting DNB tracks here, I'd get flamed into oblivion 	dubstep	1293930088

those are definitely dubstep. once again look at my model. Those are all 140bpm with a half time snare. The problem is people posting electro-house here and claiming that "dubstep evolved", when it's simply not the case	dubstep	1293930410

thank you for understanding my point :)	dubstep	1293930538
nah, Bassnectar does breakbeats, which is much faster, with a different beat structure. I wouldn't say he incorporates dubstep parameters since he's been around way longer than thatAlthough he crosses over to dubstep enough that I don't think it's an issue, especially since that collab with Datsik 	dubstep	1293930635
http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/music.swf this is pretty close i think.	dubstep	1293930886
I meant the definition to be a guideline, not a tight definition. 95% of dubstep is at 140 more or less, not necessarily exact. And the half time feel is what gives it the 2step swing.I don't think anyone could argue that hyperdub isn't dubstep (although you could argue its closer to garage), but my point is that electro is blatantly NOT dubstep, and everyone here seems to think it is.The genre is already loose enough, but there's no reason to cause unnecessarily overlap with something that is already established and exists	dubstep	1293931119
for sure, check out Far Too Loud too, similar production.I linked to r/electro as well, they have some good stuff 	dubstep	1293931347
Heh, to respond to your DA, Cockney Thug met my criteria of what I defined dubstep to be. Based around a bassline, 2-step beat, and half time snare. Same with Skream. In fact, the two are already prominent dubstep artists and the songs compare nicely alongside their body of work. Personally, when i write dubstep I try to incorporate elements from other genres, such as electro, fidget, and trance. But the vast difference occurs when you compare something like dubstep to house. The two have insanely different beat structures. And when the two do mix (see [Elite Forces remix of Subsonic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60CK8Zm5FNg)) the end result is more like breakbeats, due to the spacing inbetween kicks.	dubstep	1293931899
I love my filthy basslines, but r/fg is perfect for those times you need to drink some tea while it's raining outside 	dubstep	1293932089
I never said i wanted a blanket an on Skrillex!Dubstep isn't ambiguous. Dude listen to the shit I linked, specifically Kill Everybody. It's as fucking electro as you can get. Just because he started out making dubstep doesn't mean his entire career is stuck to making "new types of dubstep". These genres have been around for a long time. It's 130bpm. 4/4. Snares on the 2/4. Show it to any DJ or producer and they'll tell you it's electro. My point is that why would you post electro in r/**dubstep**? 	dubstep	1293932740
They sure do. But dubstep didn't evolve to sound like electro. Electro has been around for way longer. It's just that some dubstep artists started making electro and certain people assumed that it is the genre evolving.I'm not saying it can't evolve, hell I put electro leads in my dubstep all the time. But what is presently being posted here is simply another version of house	dubstep	1293932956
I agree with you. I wasn't trying to say the BPM HAS to be 140. Just that for the most part that's what it comes out to be (I can glance at traktor and my dubstep folder is definitely 99% 140)I'm segregating a lot of Skrillex songs because they're closer to Electro-House than some earlier derivative of dubstep/garage/2-step. I do value your input though :)	dubstep	1293933087
But that's not my point. I think the song is great, but just doesn't fit in to the rest of this subreddit. Rather than stopping the effect, I wanted to go back to the initial cause; to define what dubstep is.Don't get me wrong, deadmau5 has a real winner on his hands now, Feed Me/Spor is a beast, and that song is great. There's just nothing dub or step about itEDIT: on a completely unrelated note, thanks for linking RES, I had it on my desktop for FireFox, but I didn't know they made it for Chrome too	dubstep	1293933222
but what are they borrowing from dubstep? Growling basslines? You can find those anywhere.My reasoning is that I've been mixing electro since before I've heard of Skrillex/Feed Me, so when i heard of them, it didn't sound any different than what I already knew as electro. So seeing that stuff start popping up here made me roll my eyes because it really wasn't combining anything new. It was just a bit different than what people are used to.You can find the "textures and sounds" in Neurofunk too, but that has nothing at all to do with dubstep	dubstep	1293934146

Well, to begin. What do you think brostep is? Doctor P/Flux Pavillion? If so, I can't say I have a problem with that. They're still dubstep in every way except for the fact that there is a lot of midrange. I'm not a fan personally, but I can't really argue against it.What really gets me is stuff like Chrispy/Dayn where it's just a noisy/annoying lead and no bass at all.Can we just NOT discuss this? Nobody will ever end up happy. We're not making a r/brostep, because it's not even a real genre. It's just a part of dubstep as much as Soulja Boi is a part of rap.	dubstep	1293943942

I call it dubstep because it fits the tempo, fits the half time, and even the production is similar to other stuff that I listen to that is considered dubstep. I have a feeling you spend more time in r/futuregarage than here anyway	dubstep	1293944605
love this tune. i seriously can't get enough of Excision/subvet	dubstep	1293945107
this would be absolutely spectacular. I'll put it on my to-do (or to-ruin) list :D	dubstep	1293945196
10bpm is a huge amount when it comes to dance music. Especially when it comes to being full time or half time, or 4/4 or 2/4. BPM is very important to a genre because it dictates how fast a song is. If you took a 175bpm song and made it 140, it becomes a completely different animal	dubstep	1293947861
i blame deadmau5 personally :(I liked the brostep vs dubstep debates because at least the people arguing seemed well educated about their genres, but now theres all these new people who cant tell their Tiestos from their Wolfgangs 	dubstep	1293947921
and whats wrong with that? Pendulum is fucking awesome.When I mention Drum n Bass I tend to hear a lot more about Netsky and Noisia (also great DnB producers). You can't qualify different tastes in music unless you've spent a great deal of time producing them.I can tell you for a fact that making "brostep" is just as difficult as making "dubstep".  Especially to get on top of the pileArtists like Excision/Datsik spends MONTHS synthesizing and resampling their basslines. That shit is really fucking complex. They didn't get a following like they did by being "boring and monotonous" 	dubstep	1293952434
Excision, Flux Pavillion, Datisk, and Bassnectar are more dubstep than Skrillex and deadmau5. I think we can start with that. 	dubstep	1293952545
except brostep isn't a real genre, and was made up mostly by people who didn't like a certain trend in dubstep. Electro-House has been around for much longer.I'd rather deal with a little bit of midrange (oh no! what will we do!) than something that's not even in the same ballpark	dubstep	1294033840
Dude I don't think you've EVER actually produced anything in that case.Create me a decent version of a Flux Pavillion/Doctor P song, or recreate a bassline from an Excision/Datsik song. I've been producing for several years now and I still can't match their level of musicianship.If anything, it's easy as fuck to make this so called "Real dubstep". All it is is a bunch of random ass percussion with a swing and a reverb added, then a rolling subbass, maybe some old movie samples thrown in.	dubstep	1294034047

"cheap set of digital tables" does not compute honestly. If you're going to get into DJing, cheap is NOT the way to go. If you have shitty equipment, it's going to be difficult to do anything.DJ equipment doesn't devalue quickly, so i'd say go on craigslist and look stuff up, or look into getting a MIDI controller like the Xponent or Hercules MK2.Otherwise get a pair on regular turntables and a DVS system like Torq or Traktor.Once again, don't expect it to be cheap :P	dubstep	1294208195

Oh for sure. Just like any genre there's a lot of terrible, awful stuff, and some really amazing artists. I personally love everything on Rottun, Propa Tingz, Numbernin6, Reso, etc, shit that could be considered "brostep" by "purists" (or: Douchebags).Although I wish people would try to stay away from the unfiltered noise leads (i.e. Chrispy, Flux Pavillion).

I'm assuming a lot of people (such as me) got apple products such as iPods as gifts.

Keep calling it dubstep. As far as anyone is concerned, that's what it is. As long as it has bass (better make the mirrors on my car shake), I think it's all good 	dubstep	1295230490
millions? Last I checked Rusko, excision, datsik, 12th planet, etc are still saying "dubstep" on their flyers... I think getting THAT changed is going to take more effort.My point of view here is that I've invested a lot of time into dubstep. I've been listening, mixing, and (trying) to produce this stuff for about 4-5 years now. I think it takes enormous dedication and skill to be able to produce like some of these artists, and then some self-righteous person goes and calls all of it stupid and that's it's only meant for "frat bros" which essentially translates to "this is stupid and only drunk frat kids would want to listen to it because it has no musical depth and is popular".	dubstep	1295232504
i'm with you on r/futurebeats. both dubstep/brostep have been lacking lately (in my opinion of course). I hate it when people spend more time complaining about whether something is "real" dubstep or not rather than simply commenting on the quality of tracks.Even worse is the overwhelming presence of stuff that's not even remotely coming close to being considered either, like all the clonemau5/skrillex/feed me electro that keeps popping up 	dubstep	1295297340
...and good for him?I don't like him because I think his old band sucked and he's just trying to capitalize on a growing market with deadmau5 (and now Spor). He does mainly electro btw, but if you want to make this a debate about brostep fine. The reason people don't like stuff like Chrispy and Dayn and anything from Chronos is because there's no damn bass to it. All the songs are just one huge bassline (that somehow never even touches 130hz) that loops every 16 bars. That being said, there's some fucking awesome "brostep" artists that are bringing new things to the table (i.e. cookie monsta, flux, excision, datsik, bassnectar now (mb)).Just because Skrillex is popular does not mean everyone has to like him. Also, Kanye West is a very good producer, not a bad lyricist, but I somehow doubt many people would tell you that he's a great artist and everyone should listen to him (at least on here)My thesis statement here is: You can't force people to like music that they don't like. Telling me that "oh he's a good guy! You are all just jealous!" does not help the case. I don't like his production, no matter how complex it is, and that's really as far as it goes. 	dubstep	1295418915
I do not understand how you can put Skrillex on a pedestal for loading up a sampler and mashing buttons and then knock down Distance for spending months synthesizing and automating a bassline. I understand I've already thrown objectivity out the window, but you can't tell us that everyone has different tastes and then knock down another producer.	dubstep	1295419176
Well he jumped from a screamo band that got lost in the ocean of piss that is metalcore to an up-and-rising genre, definitely a capitalist at heart	dubstep	1295419312
This is super cool!&gt;Jack: Your music has been labelled as “brostep” sometimes, what do &gt;you think of that title?&gt;Tomba: They can call it whatever they want, as long as they keep talking about it and I keep doing my thing.

Look I'm all for not over-categorizing genres, but you can't deny that there is a point where it needs to happen. If genres didn't exist there would be no way to categorize artsit and sounds, and add structure to the whole damn thing. I know he's probably referring to people bitching about brostep vs dubstep (which wouldn't be a problem if the "Brostep" haters weren't such asshats), but you can't deny that there is a reason we have separate subreddits for /r/electro and /r/dubstep. They are fundamentally different genres of music. It's impossible to deny that fact, as I can open up ableton and physically show how different they are.	dubstep	1296018767
No, there'd be no way. Although the sounds would be differnet, the overall arrangement would be the same. You'd have your subbass, your drums, build ups, leads, etc. I suppose there'd be a lack of a real subbass if it's particularly bro-ey dubstep (which in my mind completely defeats the point of the music), and maybe the percussion/drums would be really thin (i heard a song with no hi-hats once, wtf?), but other than that there wouldn't be much separating good dubstep production with good "brostep" production, in my mind at least	dubstep	1296070480

Most of the time we're scrambling to find the next song to play and then trying to figure out how to work it in without anything clashing, and then figuring out if it will be receptive or not and where to steer the set to next. DJing is as much about planning as it is execution. It's more than just "fiddling around with knobs", because you are doing everything LIVE. There isn't room or time to fuck up before a record or song starts drifting out of time with whatever you have cued up and the whole thing trainwrecks.They're jumping around because they're enjoying the moment and waiting for an opportune time to drop the next song, and because DJing is fucking fun when its working out 	dubstep	1296605523

I think the reason that there is enough shitty "Real dubstep" being posted that we need more of it. you know how many skrillex tracks were being posted here a few months back? Like, 5 on the FP every day. NOTHING to do with dubstep AT ALL other than maybe he made some tunes at 140 at some point or another, and maybe had someone dubstep related in them.I understand what you're saying. It doesn't HAVE to be only 140bpm (it's half time so it seems like 70) with LFO. But it can't be 130 4/4 with synth stabs either. The way I see it, if it can be posted in another subreddit and belong there more than it would here (i.e. Noisia in /r/dnb or /r/darkstep or basically anything not /r/dubstep), then it shouldn't be here. 	dubstep	1297468501

Oversaturation murders scenes and genres. People who were listening to dubstep since it started gaining traction are scared of it going the same way Metal, R&amp;B, and Rap did - dumbed down.

Uncomfortable for reddit to hear: Reading tons of self posts and circlejerking articles does not make you an expert on an issue. The world is incredibly more complex that people think.Our government is composed of people who have been studying politics, and the world their entire lives and they are still having trouble trying to sort it all out, what makes you think that "oh just legalize it!" or "tax the rich!" are such "obvious" solutions?

While I see what point you're making, how can we tell who's qualified and not without degrees?

But then you'd need to have properly standardized tests for pretty much everything as well as a consensus on all of it. I thikn the college system right now proves to employers that not only can you deal with mundane bullshit and be able to power through things that are difficult, but also show them your interests and how you are pursuing them. I go to class because I genuinely like learning the material. Yeah getting drunk on the weekends is a blast too, but that doesn't mean that I don't care about what I'm doing. Also, it's possible to go to a community college first and transfer to a more specialized or renown school later (what im doing now myself).What's to say that to pass your standardized test you won't have to just cram enough material for a week then forget it all after youre done?

The same people who care about what brand of car they're buying, or what type of movie they're about to watch. It's just categorization.Dubstep has a rather stoic definition to the point where it's pretty easy to discern what isn't dubstep from what is.Sure, it gets shaky once you get under the 2-step umbrella, but there's a clear cut difference between Electro, DnB, and Dubstep.If it didn't matter, I wouldn't be going through the New section looking for stuff that didn't belong here.

When I first saw them live, they played mostly In Silico/Hold Your Colour stuff (duh, the only 2 albums..), but the In Silico stuff was amazing.I love Showdown, Other Side, Granite, Mutiny, and Propane Nightmares because they still felt like DnB while having the energy of fast paced rock songs."When I'm falling down, will you pick me up again?" what the flying fuck rob swire?	dubstep	1301103989

I don't get it at all. It's basically the same 16 bars repeated for the entirety of the song, and a little bit of subbass to go along with it.

sounds good, I think soundcloud gives a 2 hour maximum but if we all have 15 minutes mixes and 8 people or less it should work out. you could also just make a subreddit for this, and just post them all there because it would be easier to use the dropdown menu thing to listen to all of them.

Yeah I'm just not a fan. I kind of liked his first release, but most of it just sounded like a clusterfuck. Now he's completely blown up and is very overhyped IMO.

Hes da best!" and proceed to pee themselves while listening to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites for the umpteenth time.I don't get the hype, much less why people INSIST on reposting him here every goddamn hour. 	dubstep	1302122575
Look, guy. It's not a matter of opinion. I took your "dubstep" (mind you, this is about the 50th time today someone has posted this track), and [tapped it out](http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm) to confirm whether or not it belonged here. Lo and behold, 172/175 bpm, half-time snare, perfect for r/drumstep (as another post has pointed out), not so much for here.Thank you for contributing	dubstep	1302134211
I buy it on beatport/iTunes/AmazonBet you weren't expecting that, huh?! 	dubstep	1302134442
So what do you suggest then? Let everything in no matter what genre it actually is? I know people here would also probably like Noisia, Run DMT, and Kraddy but I don't post those because this is r/**dubstep**!Skrillex isn't even dubstep to begin with, he just has maybe 3-5 tracks that are dubstep and there are some remixes that are too. Also, I do flag everything that could **belong in another subreddit**. As it happens, we have an r/drumstep, and this would perfectly fit in there. What are you complaining about? 	dubstep	1302139268
Personally, I'd want to go as far as to urge people to keep mixes around the 17minute mark. Getting the community to listen to about 8 mixes at 20 minutes each is not something people have the attention span for (even most producers can't handle making more than 2:30 of a track!)12 songs is definitely a good number though! I look forward to participating in this, as well as hearing what you guys can come up with!big ups for putting this together!	dubstep	1302141824

haha, I stand corrected! 	dubstep	1302198771
not disagreeing with you, but I'm just thinking of it from the standpoint of getting people to vote. Making people listen to a few hours of dubstep doesn't seem as reasonable to me as a bunch of 20 minute mixes. 	dubstep	1302198933
oh damn, my bad dude, completely missed the... bold red text :(	electrohouse	1302199671
I think in your case, an hour or 2 hour long mix would be more beneficial because you'd be looking for ability to remain consistent for a long period of time. It's pretty easy to plan out a 20 minute set and remain consistent with it, but an hour long mix is a different story, especially to keep it interesting for a listener.just my 2 cents, although reading back you basically covered this in the end of your 2nd paragraph, lol	dubstep	1302200470
I guess that would depend on whether you were trying to moderate what kind of music gets in or leave it up to the community to decide. On one hand, people could vote in a sound that you don't necessarily feel should be represented on air, but on the other hand, maybe the people will have better judgement than you.You could do both though, maybe have the community select a winner, and if you feel that someone also did a very good job, give them a slot as well?	dubstep	1302209249

Nah, it's just electro.There are some dubstep tunes on it, sure, but he's not doing anything new. If he put out a country song, people would probably be posting that in here too because they are twats.If you really had to break it down, he's an electro producer who does dubstep some of the time. 	dubstep	1302251285
sounds like dubstep, i think it's been posted here more than a few times though, I remember removing reposts because it got submitted so often lol 	dubstep	1302289988
Personally, I want to hear more reese basslines from dnb [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kupEMO6FGzo) (the beginning of the song in particular).It has shown up in a lot of songs [SPL &amp; Triage - Bushido](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA3AOvMBvAM), and lots of Excision tracks (because he also used to produce dnb). It's an awesome sound and it takes lots of production value to make it sound properly kick-assMore bangers:[Trillbass - Bring It Live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQZdexLRhJY)[Dubtek, Droid Sector &amp; Sook - The Trancening (Sook Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_52suMFXfuA)[Aeph - Bad Wolf](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrIi3IV7Cc)	dubstep	1302384386
A lot of remixes suck because they don't incorporate any of the elements of the original song. It's just the beginning of the original, then a completely different tune at the drop.that being said, most of those remixes really suck.Also, say what you will about the end result of the production, but the process is very difficult.

Nearly 90% of dubstep will fit this category, although there's always some deviation.  I like to think of it as "if it could reasonably go into another subreddit, it probably should", as in, if a song is 172 bpm but is also half time with a lot of dubstep elements (wobbles, bass, etc), it's probably r/drumstep.I try not to remove stuff that's "Arguably" dubstep, but if someone is posting stuff that is obviously electro/house or dnb/drumstep (or even the 50000th skrillex repost...), then it gets removed, so I wouldn't worry too much about it	dubstep	1302726617

as a die-hard NIN fan and an individual very fond of dubstep, I hope that this *never* happens. It just makes so little sense. Dubstep is, for the most part, dance music, something pretty far from what he's tried to accomplish. Seeing Trent pair up with Bassnectar would just seem... i dunno "below" him I guess would be a way to put it. I see it as if a very well respected band, let's take Radiohead for instance, suddenly decided "hey, we're going to make cheesy electro now!" It just seems really odd to me. I could see him collaborating with someone like Burial... *maybe* but Thom Yorke already took that route. Maybe a throwback to Industrial and collab with Current Value? still doubtfulThat being said, if he has any opinion of the genre, it's probably what everyone else thinks: lots of terrible shit and some really amazing stuff :P	dubstep	1303198808
I see your point as well, but Bassnectar rarely does any of the ambient breakbeats he used to do. It's all about bangers bangers bangers now.Dubstep is pretty constricted too, if you waver too much from the 140bpm half time, it becomes future garage, or drumstep, or any of the other weird 2-step genres. But, who knows :P	dubstep	1303199285
Taking the highest voting songs and providing them all to be able to be downloaded freely in a .rar isn't even "questionably" legal as far as copyright is concerned.We're a pretty big subreddit and it's not something we want to get involved in, however likely that may be. making a playlist, a chart, or even compiling them into a mix is totally fine as far as i'm concerned, but we don't want to advocate piracy	dubstep	1303235653
ok? Feel free to do whatever you want, we're not going to stop you (or care for that matter). But we can't be advocating piracy on here, especially with the amount of other artists/attention we receive. If he wants to create an email list and send you all the tracks anyway, I doubt any of us will care, we just don't want it on here	dubstep	1303247569
Lil Wayne doesn't introduce people to hip hop,he introduces them to more shitty rap music.Skrillex isn't even really a dubstep artist, all he does is get people to listen to everyone else who tires to mimic his production (see: Feed Me, who is conveniently signed to the same label)	dubstep	1303327959
I don't like him because I think he's just trying to cash in on the popularity that "filthy dubstep" was getting. His first album came out of nowhere and suddenly hit charts everywhere because of his connections. Then he got a record deal with deadmau5 and at that point it didn't matter how good/bad he was, he was going to be popular anyways.Listen to My Name is Skrillex and compare it to some of his newer shit. He really doesn't have to try to make good music anymore, people will swallow it up no matter what. I'm also tired of his fans. Dubstep used to be about being able to manage space and flow, and now it's ZOMG LISTEN TO THIS FILTHY DROP LOL! I get it, I like filthy dubstep too... but half of the shit that comes up in the New section here is just mundane white noise at this point. You can be filthy and still bring originality to it (listen to 16bit)&gt;I understand when underground hip-hop heads that listen to lyrical masterminds with meaningful lyrics rip on the popular rap artist that have no skill and just talk about garbage. But with electronic music it's not like anyone is trying to get a message across it's just something to dance to.It's not any different, music can still convey a message/feeling without using any words.Oh, another reason I dislike skrillex is because you guys insist on reposting him 50 times every goddamn day. If he shat on a keyboard and put the result on soundcloud I guarantee it would be submitted 5000 times here. 	dubstep	1303328353
Oh nice! Didn't know you guys were on reddit! I'll try to tune in more often, this is definitely better than what you guys play during the day ;)	dubstep	1303369130
For all the arguing that goes on here, I don't think i've seen very many posts that would argue differently...I've seen people complaining about the existence of brostep, but never anyone that would try to deny that it's fundamentally dubstep.I guess today is "let's complain about other people bitching" day...	dubstep	1303612221
seriously? How is that a problem? He typed up an essay recommending dubstep that he thinks is good. He has a point too, Doctor P, Flux, Datsik, wouldn't even exist if it weren't for those artists and that deeper sound. If you don't like it, just move on. At the very least, counter appropriately with a post of your favorite type of dubstep and why its good.Yeah BioQuark may be arguing a lost cause over definitions, but I wouldn't go as far as to say it's hampering our "discussions" 	dubstep	1303613279

I'm with you here. Although, I think the history of dubstep would be a lot more tedious to write up and summarize. There are so many different artists and sounds to factor in that I dont know how accurate it would be. Plus, I think most people just want the end result: the music.What would be cool is if we could make a guide to all the different types of dubstep out there. It should be fairly easy to categorize and clump stuff together, if only by the label that releases them.i.e., Circus records and artists that are similar to them (cookie monsta, doctor p), hyperdub, Rottun, hollow point, Purple, etc.Some kind of a quick start guide 	dubstep	1303772364

Sorry but we can't have this be on the forum. mp3 sharing doesn't even fall under "questionably legal", and now that we're taking off in a bit way (almost 900 new subscribers in the last 2 weeks), we (the mods) would prefer to keep this subreddit as clean as possible. Also, some of those tracks are unreleased, and if you heard about what happened to Jakes, you'd see why we're trying to prevent this sort of thing. 	dubstep	1303957242
BSE = godlike	dubstep	1303957421
I'm not debating that. I agree that music piracy is a delicate issue and that there are arguments both for and against it, as well as numerous justifications from both sides for their actions. However, we simply cannot condone such action here. Leaking and posting tracks is a big slap in the face for the producer that made them, and not something we want to represent as a community	dubstep	1303959752
oh yes, encouraged in fact. All we're saying is that uploading tracks that are on sale and giving them out for free publicly is discouraged. You can post up links to streams, promo tunes, whatever, we just want to avoid piracy	dubstep	1303959884
If it made the musicians happy, they could release the tracks for free themselves. Exposure only means so much. Music gear costs money, and so does mastering. Also, my views aren't factored in here. This is a decision made collectively. We have had people bring up the fact that there is blatant music piracy going on and that we aren't doing anything about it. So, now we're making it official. It's really not that difficult to, you know, just *not* post that kind of stuff here. Are you really going to try and justify taking someone else's work and giving it out for free here? It's not really any kind of statement, it's just something we'd rather not deal with 	dubstep	1303961551
of course, even posting up streaming links to unreleased tracks is totally fine by us. I'm talking like "hey does anyone have a 320 of *x*" and then a reply of the file uploaded to a filesharing or torrent site, or what was going on with the Weekly Drop which was just a compilation of mp3s packaged together. 	dubstep	1303961677
[this guy knows what he's talking about](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/gyi0w/meditate_on_bassweight/)	dubstep	1303961770
True as that may be it is near impossible to reach the sound quality produced by high end studios. There's a reason people send off tracks to get mastered rather than doing it themselves, and that's because it's a.) really fucking hard (I've spent the last week trying to make a tune sound good, and it's still shite when played in my car) and b.) you need really expensive soundcards + monitors to get it anywhere, but you already mentioned that	dubstep	1303967019
if you're being sarcastic, then you've missed the entire point. No one is arguing whether or not  music piracy has some positive aspects.The point is: it's illegal. Many artists don't condone others giving away their hard work for free, and it's not your place to tell them what's best.	dubstep	1303968006
I don't give a shit either but I will be deleting all of your mediafire links. Go make a "r/shitipirated" if it really let's you sleep at night	dubstep	1304020973
I am definitely repeating myself now. I agree. Releasing music for free is very beneficial and in many cases superior to $2 singles. It is a little ridiculous to expect people to constantly dish out for tunes they like.But not everyone agrees, in particular, the people writing that music (see: jakes). However, my actions as moderator have to reflect the ideology of the subreddit, which is that piracy IS illegal and frowned upon. We've been asked if we supported posting of tunes up for download by not removing them and letting this turn into a filesharing forum. Of course, we don't want that.If you want to post your stuff up for free, please do. I know I love free music. But this subreddit won't become a filesharing forum to make some sort of statement 	dubstep	1304021634
you're completely right. We're in a new era of media, and there are alternatives to making a living off of music other than just selling CDs, although I do disagree that we should make it all free. Music does have value.Figure actually has it set out pretty well. He spends work on his releases, but releases a lot of tracks for free just for hype and promotion	dubstep	1304023622
well, thank you for realizing that at least, more than half the people who commented have completely missed the point.I'm not arguing that they have/haven't. I personally think releasing shit for free is the way to go in many cases because it does get the word out. But like I said, that's not the issue here 	dubstep	1304023715
THIS is a mix!!!	dubstep	1304023832
well the issue with that is that he gave out dubplates to his fellow DJs to play out, but not to release. Then somebody decided to leak them anyway. It's more of a breach of trust in this case	dubstep	1304024781
i think that's what he was saying. The time between completing a track and releasing it as a damn long one, often about a month or two. He's saying you're either going to hear his new tunes on release date, or during his shows and that's it 	dubstep	1304036197
Do you want reddit to get shut down because of something as stupid as this? I'll repeat, we had someone from a label come into IRC and grill us about if we knew that people were bundling up mp3s and releasing them for free and if we supported that. We're just not cool with it. Many of us are producers ourselves and we don't want to see our work end up in some kids 320 mp3 sharing thread just because they feel entitled to it for free. There are songs that are shared for free and some artist are cool with it, but a large portion are not (which is why they are sending it on beatport in the first place), and we wish to respect that.That being said, it's seriously not that difficult to find songs you want on the internet. In fact, if you have trouble with it so much that you need to start a thread, you probably shouldn't even be listening to it if you don't want to spend the minimum effort it takes to find a song. 	dubstep	1304040041
just because he's a mod doesn't mean he's going to snap one day and attempt to remove all the posts he doesn't like.A.) that's what the rest of us are for, and B.) everyone has opinions, his is just stronger than most.Also, I randomly use distinguish because I think it looks cool and for no other apparent reason, not like it matters, I'm a person just like any of you, I just have to watch the spam filter and remove stuff that's out of place.If he upsets you so much, go submit a shitty remix of Bass Cannon just to make him fume ;) 	dubstep	1304118116

&gt; Either go all the way and no longer allow the posting of any media that is not officially endorsed by the artistYou are aware that the majority of shit uploaded to youtube are 2 minute clips released by labels right? Even more so, you realize its not affiliated with reddit in any way which thus takes the responsibility out of our hands?You are also aware that by stopping mediafire links, I'm making an effective compromise, according to your argument, to continue allowing r/dubstep to function?I think you need to brush up on your copyright if you think streaming and downloading are the same thing&gt;If people were uploading to a reddit filesharing service or something officially linked to reddit then your argument would make sense and you'd have a legitimate leg to stand on. But to censor us and say people can't post links to third party services completely unaffiliated to reddit or r/dubstep just because YOU don't agree with people sharing music via mediafire/zippyshare/etc is pretty fucking moronic.No that's not it at all. Did you even read the topic? How am I censoring you by stopping this place from becoming a filesharing forum? That's like saying a movie theater is censoring people by charging them for tickets. The fucking problem is that people were publicly making request threads for 320s of released and unreleased songs. With the whole Weekly Drop thing, it was basically a free compilation being released every week. Someone who worked with a label joined IRC and asked if our inaction as moderators approved these actions. We said no, because a.) it's illegal, and b.) there are producers that visit this subreddit and expressed their disapproval at what was going on.So, in order to cover our own asses, we agreed that we weren't going to allow people to share files. GOD FORBID you lot actually have to LOOK for the music you want to listen to now. How is this an issue? Are you really in uproar because you don't want to pay for tunes? Also, as I mentioned about 100000x before, I don't care about piracy. This is an action being taken because of the need to moderate, and that's what I am: a moderator. 	dubstep	1304133435

2 things1.) i know of him because he lives about a town over, 2.) &gt;"I invite you guys to contribute and I will add it to the topic."Find his record label and I will add it to this list of **record labels** that publish dubstep releases. Alternatively, find me a release of his that was published with one of the labels listed and I will add it there	dubstep	1304226173

how is it not a straw man? it's comparing charitable atheists against a single non-charitable evangelical as if it's some sort of proof that people don't need religion to be good, but that belief in god can still cause people to be dicks?Pat robinson would be a straw man in this case. It's almost the equivalent of saying "Hitler believed in god!"	reddit.com	1304318528

We all hate skrillex because people INSIST on posting every single fucking thing he ever does. If he farts into a mic and puts it on twitter I will be removing 500 reposts of it all day. He's a fine producer, but he is tremendously overhyped, and we are sick of hearing about him. He's essentially the Nickelback of EDM, with Deadmau5 behind him as Kanye West. It's not about the numbers. Fucking Swedish House Mafia recycled a sample loop straight out of a pack and hit #1. We want quality over quantity, and people saying "oh it doesn't matter as long as the beat is good!" doesn't help the case. I won't apologize for being passionate about something I care about, nor having a strong opinion. 	dubstep	1304457610

i swear, go and flood the page with real dubstep. Do it.im serious. The reason there's so much skrillex is because you mofos never submit anything and the other people do. Don't complain about the content on a **user-submitted** site	dubstep	1305427170
That's not my point. First off, majority of Skrillex songs aren't even dubstep and get submitted here anyways (i remove at least 5 per day). Second off, EVERYTHING HE EVER DOES gets posted on here. It's annoying because he represents a sounds that a lot of us are now really starting to despise, and it doesn't help that quite a lot of people think he is a representative of dubstep.Also, you know what the comments section is for? It's for making comments about the music. If someone doesn't like him, they are fully entitled to make a post about why. Of course "dis sucks" isn't contributing at all, but there are some good points made sometimes.	dubstep	1305498314
Dubstep is a pretty broad genre, but it's still vastly different from electro, which is mostly what he does. Yes he does make *some* dubstep, some of it is ok, and quite a lot of it sounds exactly the same, and gets posted over and over again here.He's essentially the T-Pain of Dubstep now, in that people think he represents rap/hip-hop when in reality his style is just a dumbed down version of what it once was.You can listen to all the Skrillex you want, but don't complain about other people not liking him. He's a big boy now and can (and should be able to) handle the criticism, especially when there is a lot of truth to it 	dubstep	1305504733
Read this in another thread&gt; *to person smoking* "You know cigarettes will kill you right?"&gt;"my grandma is a 100 years old"&gt; "did she smoke?"&gt; "No, she minded her own fucking business"	AskReddit	1305507139
I've noticed how the more popular dubstep gets the more alienated everyone feels. When Rusko and Caspa were making the wub wubs, the traditional 2-step guys were complainingWhen Borgore and Datcision started doing his over-the-top filthy biz, both the people in the previous categories were complainingThen Flux/Doctor P started Circus up and everyone from before began hating on itThen deadmau5 signed Skrillex/Spor Me, and everyone from the previous categories has banded together.I'm not saying one group is necessarily right or wrong, just that the "worse" dubstep gets the more the people who used to hate on the new trends band together.Something to consider. 	dubstep	1305525440

How is this surprising? Latest hot new DJ/producer of hard electro is more popular than old school turntablist?Pop music has always been more popular.

Doesn't have to be, but I'd suggest you leave it undownloadable just because it would be redundant otherwise, at least for voting. Afterwards do whatever.	dubstep	1305706450
I nominate you as dubsteppitor of the year	dubstep	1305706502

you can still submit it as long as it's not on some sort of compilation or release already. 	dubstep	1305747542
for DJing i have a few folders such as "Ambient/FG stuff" which is chilled out, mellow dubstep as well as a lot of Future Garage, then Drumstep/Filth which is... well, Borgore, Flux, Kanji Kinetic, some 16bit, etc.Then my fav is "Rottun sounding shit" which is a lot of Rottun releases, and dark sounds that very well could be from Rottun	dubstep	1305760999
It's still here! But it's not often on the front page here, it won't be on your facebook, and it most certainly won't be on your local radio	dubstep	1305927012
not really dubstep, but a sick tune nonetheless 	dubstep	1305927093
fuck that noise. Only stuff we remove is stuff that's blatantly NOT dubstep, i.e. drum n bass, drumstep (although we allow that sometimes for diversity requirements), future garage  (although a lot gets through for the same reason), and electro (not even close to bass).Only people qualified to give you shit for it "not being dubstep" are the mods, and from the IRC chat I'd say everyone can be expected to make reasonable decisions regarding thatEDIT: my point is that you should submit this shit! There are way too many comments with people complaining about the content here... but reddit is driven by user-submitted content, meaning that if you don't like what's being displayed, that's YOUR fault for not submitting it!	dubstep	1305933805
a huge part of it is intellectual masturbation. People love arguing for the things they care about, and for us that happens to be bass 	dubstep	1305939888

I don't even understand why it matters... a very large portion of music is written in 4/4. It's easy to structure and it makes sense.Sounds like someone took a music theory class and now thinks they know everything and are the ultimate expert regarding all things music 	dubstep	1306102179
please show me a dnb tune that is not in 4/4, and that isn't drumstep which is at half time	dubstep	1306103585
That dnb tune is most definitely 4/4. In fact, I got it, put it in Ableton Live, and can show you that it is because it fits into a perfect 4 bar loop with the snare on the 2nd beat each time. -&gt; http://i.imgur.com/O6wxa.pngYou can also see the song is in 4/4 at 172 bpm, like 90% of dnb.I have taken music theory classes, and I'm a DJ/Producer, so it's very important for me to be able to count beats, and the fact that the majority of mixable music is in a standard time signature greatly helps that case. 	dubstep	1306105075
dubstep does not change the time signatures throughout. That entire song is in 2/4 140bpm in 8 bar phases 	dubstep	1306105266
they're still in 4/4, I can make a perfect 4 bar loop for them and they sound consistent. I'm pretty sure that nearly all music has a consistent time signature throughout that follows each part (lead, drums, bass), otherwise that wouldn't make any sense and it certainly wouldn't be mixable/dancable	dubstep	1306105493
wow I don't think im on nearly enough drugs to fully appreciate thisGreat tune though	dubstep	1306120539

me :&lt;but srs, I think all the people who are "under-appreciated" are either moving up in popularity or are just simply not appealing to the majority that would be required to make them "over-appreciated" (which isn't a bad thing at all, I'm just saying they're probably not going to be played on the radio any time soon...)	dubstep	1306262110
ups for Cheshire	dubstep	1306285031
you.. don't have to. It's based on the domain I think. You should've just messaged the mods with one of your submissions so we can see if it's getting flagged or not because we can't keep track of everything that gets in the spam filter	dubstep	1306355277
nah, voting will go on for a few days (2-4, depending amount of votes that happens). If the track is not picked then yes you would retain release rights. Only reason for that whole issue is that one would be unable to release a track commercially if it's already on a free compilation w/ CC (well you could I guess, but wtf is the point if it's already available for free?), although you would still be free to give it out yourself/with your label, whatever	dubstep	1306371793

If a lot of them are (i see a few that are on 9), I'll wait a bit to see if voting resolves that, or just include them anyway. top 14 was an arbitrary number really, I don't see a reason to exclude people just because they tied, but I'd rather not go over 17 tracks 	dubstep	1306788321

It really is what you make of it. I took 20 units a quarter, scheduled my classes nicely, and now I'm done with an entire quarter of free time.I asked about you being from Norcal because my school (Foothill College) has a rep for having an awesome Astronomy program (at least around here), so I was wondering if you were from there coincidentally 	AskReddit	1306827343

For your track I say add more sweeps and effects for the intro. You need to have very subtle changes and various elements to give it character. I'd say aim for introducing something new and taking something away every 2-4 bars, depending on how crazy you want to get.A quiet pad goes a long way towards adding texture to a song.You also might want to add a lot of subtle delay and reverb to your hats, this way they will take up more space but they shouldn't take over your mix.When you're finally done with the mixdown and composition, mastering is the way you really put your track on the next level, but that process is way more complicated than I can describe in one post (let alone even lie to you and say that I understand it), so I suggest either watching youtube tutorials on mastering, or sending your track out to a professional (but that costs money).The main "drop"/verse of your tune sounds solid, although I think you could work in some panning and layering/EQing of sounds, as it sounds a bit cluttered right now.	dubstep	1307076313

Can we seriously stop talking about him now?I'm tired to seeing every little thing Skrillex related getting so many upvotes.We get it, a lot of people don't like him, a lot of people feel the need to defend him. There are TONS of interesting artists out there.This is r/dubstep. For things relating to and about dubstep, not r/skrillex. He also doesn't need you to defend him. 	dubstep	1307661062
remixing Pink Floyd just seems... like a rather daunting task honestly. It would be rather difficult to make a remix that doesn't ruin the original song, so I'm always skeptical when artists attempt it 	dubstep	1307661229
*edit 2*: gonna use this opportunity to make a general statement. I would like to say that posts bitching about the direction of dubstep, certain artists, etc are not helping us move forward as a community. We all have different opinions and perspectives on these issues, and reviving them week after week is counter-productive. Judging from the up/downvotes in this thread, as well as several comments (hey, mine to be included), we should all chill the fuck out and enjoy the bassweight.I'm going to remove all non-contributing posts in the future (i.e. "why does skrillex suck so much?" "why is dubstep boring and stupid?") because there are mature and intelligent ways to discuss such topics. It's sad that "nigga plz" got more upvotes than every single song here----People need to shut the fuck up about him *in general*.I don't give a shit if you're his #1 fan and think he's the greatest thing since deadmaotiesto and feel the need to defend every single one of his actions.I don't like him. I think his music is repetitive, and that he's only in it to sell. In fact, the rumor about him having a ghost producer seems very likely to me.That being said, I still approve all the songs he makes (that are dubstep) and have no problem with people enjoying his music (although I still think its stupid).THAT being said, I hope today is the last time we have a "let's talk about skrillex" thread before I start removing them on basis of **beating a dead horse**. We are never going to arrive at any reasonable conclusion. Skrillex haters will never convince his fans that he is shit. Skrillex fans will never convince his haters that he is jesus. It's over. EDIT: woah, didn't expect so many upvotes... I feel like I should explain myself a bit. Sorry for ranting about Skrillex a bit... but I hope you guys agree with my point that neither side is going to budge on this, so the best thing for everyone would be to attempt to avoid the issue and move on with our lives. An intellectual discourse about the direction of the genre is fine as long as everyone remains civil... and it's in context. 	dubstep	1307661548
Psystep? aw yeee. Great tune 	dubstep	1307662931

yup, totally what i said. 	dubstep	1307677309
I'll agree with unnecessary. I was trying to say that I personally don't like him, but it is silly to start a thread simply to argue with people and attempt to change their opinion of him. Maybe my point wasn't clear (probably wasn't), and i apologize for that.If those sorts of discussions are contained in the comments of his songs, then I guess that's a bit more fair since they are pertinent to the topic and you can just ignore the whole post if you want, vs something like this eating up a spot on the front page (and having wtf... 250 upvotes...)	dubstep	1307677983

I like this idea. Honestly, one of the only reason dubstep.fm is linked in the sidebar is because it plays.. well, dubstep :P.A station is out of my technical expertise, but I think it is definitely possible. Even easier would be rather than live stream, having an archive of mixes that could be played, everything from Shambahala, to Fabric, to stuff even me and you could record. I'll talk to some people and see what we can do!Thanks for the suggestion! 	dubstep	1307839142
yeah, im over at djforums too, but it looks like faderwave is a separate entity (meaning they have it set up on a server). I think what would be more convenient than live streaming would be a podcast where we do as you said, have a few mixes sent in and then publish 1 or 2 a week. the thing with live streaming is that there would have to be a server that is constantly circulating archives and mixes, and that would cost money for bandwidth, plus it would be a bitch to maintain.So I'll talk to some of the other mods about setting up a podcast, shouldn't be too difficult. 	dubstep	1307840915
this is really sick, tech has some serious flow	dubstep	1307843067
we definitely try to. Only time I let stuff in that's not dubstep is when it's a really sick track an there haven't been as many other submissions. I.e. is there is already a bunch of drumstep or glitch up then I'll delete it but a little variety is good sometimes	dubstep	1307855232
good idea, but I feel like this would work better with the facebook page/group rather than the subreddit... although I suppose I could whip up a post every Friday or so of a track that someone has posted here, and maybe do some sort of write up	dubstep	1307855639

Made me get way more into DJing and Producing which then completely killed "real" music for me. I used to be huge into punk, metal, etc, but now it's only EDM like DnB and Dubstep, with only a dash of hip-hop in the mix (and then its usually related to dnb or dubstep)	dubstep	1307932320

For a question: Based on what you have seen in the past, do you think dubstep will develop into any other subgenres? Right now it seems to be speeding up into drumstep and slowing down into future garage, but do you think there are any notable trends in the past few years? 	dubstep	1308096414
Alternatively, what can we ruin for you next?	dubstep	1308096707
You bring up a very interesting point about the "label" of dubstep giving something more hype as it is "new and exciting". This makes me wonder if many artists will attempt to center dubstep back to where it came out of (I picture a dark room, lots of subwoofers, and most certainly not on the top 40 radio), or if they will ditch the label and attempt to push for another genre (future garage, 2step, etc)Of course, that implies that people care about whether they make music for a genre, or music that just happens to be in a genre 	dubstep	1308097453

let's not go that far =\Splittercore, maybe &gt;_&gt;	dubstep	1308208494
I think the biggest problem with dubstep DJs is the tendency to mix nonstop banger after banger. Excision is the worst at this IMO. There is barely 5 seconds of not-robot-noises in any of his mixes (also because he prepares nearly everything he releases)To me, mixing is all about building an atmosphere and putting a cohesive set together. You build up to a banger from 2-3 songs before it, not just "CRACKS... SKRILLEX... BIG BOSS... SWAGGA.. REASONS" and never allowing any room.Anybody can throw in big name tracks just for a reaction, to me, the real talent lies with having a set that flows together from low energy, to high energy, while bringing you along for the ride.That being said, I like 16bit, Evol Intent, and Subvert for their mixes. Subvert may not have the tightest sounding mix, but he's good at throwing in variation and different genres to make a mix that is both interesting,  and still holds your attention. 	dubstep	1308259347

I think it's mainly because there are some people who just jumped onboard because they heard skrillex or deadmau5 and now think they are on the bandwagon.It's the equivalent of someone listening to Green Day or Good Charlotte and then suddenly considering themselves part of the Punk scene vs someone who has been there since the beginning.	dubstep	1308342221
You make it sound as if it was difficult to share it before. Having it become popular is one thing, but when it upturns everything the genre was originally about upside down is quite another. There are people walking around blasting Ellie Goulding remixes from their iPhones, ripping 96kbps audio of Black Eyed Peas remixes from youtube, and then starting countless "i listened to dubstep for 2 weeks, now i have garage band and pirated massive, how can I make some too"I'm not saying I don't want people listening to it, or making any sort of general statement about what I think the genre should do. But whenever a form of music becomes popular, there is insane over-saturation going on, the flood gates open, and a lot of stuff that comes out is only heard because of hype and sales. Just wait until Top 40 stations figure out what's happening and you'l be seeing tons of Akon/T-Pain/whatever dubstep coming out, then you might consider joining the "hipster" camp :P	dubstep	1308345402
What's funny is that this keeps repeating too. People used to hate on Rusko and Caspa, but then Excision and Rottun came along... then Circus, then Skrillex/Deadmau5... at some point everyone in the previous camps is going to unite against whatever shitty trend is going to come up 	dubstep	1308345553
Maybe, but honestly... they have a point. I'm willing to be next T-pain and Akon are going to figure out dubstep is getting big and you'll have utterly awful music coming out.I like change, but a lot of the time it is for the worse	dubstep	1308356129

I like how we can say "dubstep" and to people that means the dark menacing beats of Distance, high pitched squeals and leads of Flux Pavilion, serious percussion and bass from the likes of Mala/DMZ, and sounds like they came straight from hell from Torqux/SPL.It's one seriously diverse genre, which is both annoying and awesome.If you can't find yourself dancing to it, I'm sure there is something that can cause that out there	dubstep	1308798983

I think most people complain about brostep because it's a serious degradation in quality over traditional dubstep.Everyone thinks brostep is big so everyone makes it, and thus over 90% of it is just... fucking terrible. There's plenty of dubstep that's still heavy and dance-able (datsik, pixel fist, downlink, benga, SPL), the distinction happens when you decide to throw out everything that makes dubstep great (heavy, walking basslines, shuffling beat) and stick in some cheesy chick vocals and an obnoxious "filthy" synth. 	dubstep	1309219386

Marijuana is a drug like any other and is most certainly habit forming and addictive in its own right. I love smoking pot, but please don't act like it's "oh just a plant! carl sagan smoked weed!" Also, legalizing it WILL NOT SOLVE ALL THE WORLDS PROBLEMS	AskReddit	1309229829
That may be true but cranberry muffins aren't nearly as harmful long-term as marijuana is. I've had a few friends who got caught in that hole and would smoke weed nonstop and disregard other responsibilities because "fuck it, i'll just get high". Of course it's not just the drug, but dismissing it and saying "oh it's not the weeds fault! your friend is just an idiot!" is negligent. It has high potential for abuse, and ignoring that (and the negative effects of smoking too much) is just as counter-productive and narrowminded as the anti-pot campaign 	AskReddit	1309237959
you're spot on. My point was really just that it's stupid to parade it around as if there are no downsides to smoking weed every day. Of course it's not as bad a nicotine or cocaine, etc but to say it's harmless is very narrowminded 	AskReddit	1309239882

Despite your long thought-out post, you will never change anyones mind on this topic. People are not going to say "hey... maybe it's all just dubstep after all! Different strokes for different folks! Tomato tomato!"It has already caught on too much to be changed now, this same post has been made many times and has not changed anything. I think we've been better about it though, i haven't seen nearly as much flaming for the midrange as I have a few months agoThe problem with "brostep" is that it categorizes a type of music that took Dubstep and essentially stripped it of all of it's parts. No more shuffled beat, walking bassline, well synthesized patches... just cliche female vox, random theme titles "remixed", the same overused Massive presets, intense ADD, and obnoxious production and attitude towards the genre that gave it all birth in the first place. It's all Dubstep to me (for better or worse), but I'm just telling you why people keep trying to make a distinction.	dubstep	1309287899

Ignore everything people say about wubwubs and the "Bass drop". Those are NOT defining qualities of dubstep, although they are prevalent in some dubstep tunes.Dubstep is defined by a rhythmic bassline, and the beat structure, which is 2-step with a snare on the 3, and 140bpm. This is a very rough generalization. Some tunes are full time and 140bpm, some are 135-145bpm. But, for the most part, this is it.Burial is technically future garage, his tunes are slower and have a fucking weird beat structure, and really don't follow anything conventional. However, he is *fucking awesome* and I like seeing him being posted here. 	dubstep	1310159152

I'm not going to defend it because it's hard to develop. It's one of the only DAWs that still doesn't have dual screen support, isn't 64bit, and doesn't support VST3. It has an awesome, intuitive interface, and I still use it and love it for that reason, but it is childish to defend its drawbacks.

All you have to do is pick up a fucking guitar, an amp, and look up some chord progressions. Do you realize how much effort goes into making an original electronic song?

Listen to his earlier breakbeat album and compare that to where he has ended up now.

On one hand, maybe they just ran into each other, deadmau5 liked Skrillex and his sound, signed him and everyone moved on with their lives.On the other hand, he does know what he's doing with the marketability of a symbol and the sound attached to it (think of his mau5head and the sound everyone has come to associate with it). When he tried to make dubstep, it wasn't received particularly well, but if another artist were to come out with that sound, well they would be met with more success. It would be as if any other band than Metallica were to record St Anger, and it would have been a success. I do think its kind of strange that Skrillex became big practically overnight. You can't really pull that off unless you have really good connections within the industry. 	electronicmusic	1310941333

lol, I think we have "skrillex related posts" more often than we have actual skrillex stuff posted...I think "r/dubstep getting its wish" would be more "Hey guys, I've decided to start over, make some new patches, and put the dub back in dubstep!"Very few people actually deserve physical violence, and certainly not for "making music I don't like"	dubstep	1311103099

I don't think this is necessarily true.

it is bullshit. Call of Duty can only get away with it because you can leave and join matches at will, so it ends up evening out.

Just to add on, I love that people are getting into making music and getting involved with the genre but I just want to lay out some things everyone trying to produce "dubstep" to consider.* 1.) It does NOT matter what program you use, whether you are mac or PC, or what color your socks are. Although there are ACTUAL differences between the audio quality in different programs (*cough*AbletonFailingAtNotBeing64bit*cough*), for the most part it is all subjective.* 2.) It does not need a dubstep remix* 3.) Please make some sort of comment on what you're trying to get feedback on, whether it's the mixing, composition, or sound design. Great list though, I like the idea of a [Listen] tag as well	dubstep	1311570798
wow holy shit yeah. Fuck this guy for not liking a trend in a genre he used to enjoy!	dubstep	1311570927
see, people always say that. "Oh you can just look for the good artists!" That's not the problem. The problem is that the scene is being saturated with the people who just stick shittons of samples in, a 2step beat and call it a day. Why can't he express his dislike for something? It's like saying "oh if you don't like Obama's policies then why don't you  just move?" Because trends such as this are manipulable. All it takes is artists and regular people to start promoting a certain type of music for it to change. What's that quote, "be the change you want to see in the world"?	dubstep	1311571144
Sure, all music takes effort. But a lot of the times it seems that everyone wants to make the "next chart topping banger". Every other tune is trying to one-up the one before it by being "more filthy" or "heavier bass". You can have amazing sound design without changing the synth every beat. Artists like Ajapai make amazing mixes and sounds, but composition wise the song just seems random and spastic. 	dubstep	1311571284

[From Ruskos thoughts on Brostep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEuFTBG0Rbg) - Most "energetic" dubstep is akin to someone screaming into your face for 3 hours.This tune is subtle, yet it's heavy and if it doesn't make you nod your head, tap your foot, or start skanking, I think you might need to get yourself checked out.  It's not about "supa heavy drops" or obnoxious leads. It's the atmosphere built by the track. If you played this at a party with a proper sound system I guarantee everyone would get up and start dancing to it. 	dubstep	1311636265
holy shit this is awesome! Big ups ANTI-PUGSLY! really looking forward to this. 	dubstep	1311648556
So would you be ok with a junkie living on welfare and spending all of his money on more heroin?I think you're assuming that the general population is a bunch of intelligent individuals that instantly recognize when they have a problem and are not prone to any stupid decisions or addictions. This is not the case. They will get their paychecks, collect welfare, and then blow it all on crack.	AskReddit	1311649391
Yes. If you're on welfare you should have other things to worry about other than getting high. If someone abuses cocaine to the point where they can't even afford to help themselves, why should my money be going towards their stupid decision? 	AskReddit	1311649638

So? Should Hulu start filtering out ads based on a third parties opinion while they could be receiving funding?I'm sure reddit would throw a bitch fit if hulu decided to not allow some secular group to advertiseMaybe you should go protest more often then, god forbid people take a reasonable and neutral stand towards an issue they may not even be involved with. 	pics	1311666907
I had to watch an ad about something I didn't agree with! Good thing I got a screenshot of it for karma!	pics	1311666975
I suppose, but most companies aren't there to make a statement, merely to provide a service and gain a profit. Some do, but it is rare and often times they end up going under because of it.Groups like the KKK are unable to put up advertisements because they are historically known for racial atrocities, and any company that could be seen supporting them would be hit with severe backlash.However, most people are either unaware of Scientology, or just don't care. I agree that they've (most likely) done terrible things, but they just aren't infamous enough to warrant countrywide attention.I guess you could write a very strongly worded letter to Hulu to get them to pull the ads, but they're probably being paid and don't want to bother dealing with the ponzi scheme that is scientology. 	pics	1311667507
So are you saying "No" because our government wouldn't be able to enforce it effectively, or because you feel that people should be able to abuse drugs and still qualify for welfare?If that last statement sounds a bit condescending, i apologize, I am not trying to oversimplify and demonize your point.

what I don't understand is why you guys are complaining about the content on a **user submitted site**. You do realize it's not the content that's the problem, it's the amount of people submitting it. This subreddit has over 20K members a lot of whom have very different ideas about what dubstep is than you.So instead of trying to move, why don't you just **submit more**. Show them what you think dubstep is, submit like, 10 fucking posts a day if you want of quality shit, I doubt people would mind.	dubstep	1311802250
because it's not more than half. This subreddit has plenty of great submissions and more than enough activity. Like I said, it's USER SUBMITTED CONTENT. Posts about Skream, Benga, Mala, etc get plenty of attention on here, there just aren't enough of them to counteract the shitty zelda remixes (seriously I can't wait for that BS to end). Yeah a lot of people just discovered dubstep because of their friends shitty EDC facebook posts, but that doesn't mean it's suddenly dead and everyone has to evacuate. What's that quote?

For starters, yes the first EP is a little bit heavy, but by no means what I would consider to be "shitty wobble". It doesn't have to be from the UK to qualify as "good", and it certainly doesn't have to be overbearing to be heavy.That, and there ARE some great deeper dubstep mixes in the works by people who do know what they are doing. Just because one episode isn't to your liking does not mean the rest will be like that. There is a huge variety of people here with different tastes, and it's obviously impossible to appeal to everyone at once, so there are going to be a variety of future episodes that aren't going to try to encompass everything at once.Believe it or not, I did think about this and there is a plan for the future. 	dubstep	1312602922

hey, I see what you're saying, but the problem with that argument is that ignoring it will not solve the problem. That's akin to saying "if you don't like the governments policies, then move"The proper way to enact change is to act upon it and attempt to influence others perceptions. for example, I really don't like the trend dubstep has been taking recently into oversimplified remixes and attempts to be "super filthy", so I took steps to push my own view of the genre and make it more accessible to people.Completely unrelated, but I've wanted to say this somewhere 	dubstep	1312864213

I'll agree with you on irony, but I always want to state "necessity". Being signed to a major record label is a guaranteed #1 way to get your music played fucking EVERYWHERE.Sure they could have played local shows, printed CDs, been part of an indie label that handled publishing, but then we wouldn't even be having this conversation as nobody would have ever heard of them. The picture you posted is interesting, but it by no means proves that "yes the record execs are funding the military to kill people and enslave society!"

I make drum n bass/dubstep type stuff (please don't immediately put me in the "oh he makes dubstep.." category i promise I go beyond attaching LFO to cutoff) I do mixdowns myself and either make it as polished as possible that way and then put a limiter on the master or i send it to someone to do in a much better studio environment than my room.

yup, and I have m-audio AV40 speakers (hardly pass as monitors really). I just do endless tweaking lol 	WeAreTheMusicMakers	1313297715
Haha, its cool, i love talking about music related things. I love Ableton but i hate how it's only 32 bit. I tend to max out the CPU for it whenever I hit the final stages of a tune and I have a lot of VSTs and effects around, even though I have an i7, 8gb of RAM and i'm using an Audio 4 DJ for a soundcard. I would move to Studio One Pro, but i just love Abletons arrangement and am way too attached to it now.I don't use any controllers, I just write everything in bit by bit Are you saying you leave the individual tracks without compression/EQ or the master? I try to leave the end mix at around -6 or -8 dB in case I end up sending it to anyone else to master 	WeAreTheMusicMakers	1313299472

dude are you serious? How long have you been here? Obviously not when Tetris came out, or the whole zelda step thing. Those tunes go straight to the top of the page instantly. If anything, the original sound is what gets barely any attention because people are too hopped up and excited about the latest pokemon remix.People downvote Skrillex and Doctor P not because they are not "dubstep" (although 90% of the time people posting skrillex don't even know what that word means ("hurr durr it has wobbles!")), but because they feel the songs are obnoxious and trying too hard to be "filthy"	dubstep	1313454091

It does to me, not only do I have to listen to all the content because I'm a mod here but I'm also a producer and DJ, so all these trends are very relevant to me later when my friends say "herp derp y dont u mix da zelda remix?!?!"I think i can make an objective statement that just because some kid pirated fruity loops and massive and assigned LFO to cutoff to make "da wobbulz!!!11!" does not mean it is a work of art or expression of music by any means 	dubstep	1313458107

First off, I would like to applaud you for constructing an argument not based on "dont put things in boxes man" or any of the other silly analogies that people try to use against "hipsters" like me. That was seriously a well thought out post and I will try to respond in a manner constructive to a debate.Just because I am ridiculing the "ideal of freedom of creativity" does not mean I am condemning it. I'm not simply pulling a straw man here of (questionably) poor production, i'm remarking of what the genre has become.Although you are quick to attack me as a person (and I assure you, even I think my tracks are "brostep garbage"), consider that I'm not taking sides as much as I am making a cynical remark.When a trend becomes popular, there are many people who start to cash in on it and find ways to manipulate it to reward themselves. Music is no exception. There are many artists now who are making Dubstep not as a way to express themselves, but as a way to jump onto a bandwagon. This music tends to hit the popular circuit because the people involved can circulate it in such a way and perpetuate the sound. "But why do you care, it's music and people like it"Well I can make a point, that's why I care. I think music should be made as an expression rather than a goal to move units. I don't think every goddamn theme song needs a "dubstep remix" just for the hell of it. I don't like how more and more people are trying to make dubstep but all they end up with is a sampled 2 step beat and WOB WOB WOB WOB.It's a fucking joke at this point. Look at any thread on the rest of reddit that mentions dubstep and that's what people think: its a fucking joke on the world. nobody could possibly listen to this shitty music and appreciate it.But people obviously do. People appreciate it enough to splinter off form here and form their own sub-sub communities (r/realdubstep, r/brostep (that one may not be a srs one though)).Maybe I do care too much. Honestly, i'm a little drunk and i've been doing nonstop mixing and producing to kill time until college starts again so I've been preoccupied with thinking of ways I could help show people what it is I see in this stupid 2 step beat and cranked up bassline.And yes, I am doing that, I'm a moderator of this community, I started up a podcast for us, and I do my best to show people what I think is the best possible music. It certainly doesn't help when people like you show up and tell me to fuck off and let things take their course.There's that quote "be the change you want to see in the world", well what better place to start than today?/end rant, going to get another rum and coke, and its been fun typing this all up for no apparent reason, i hope you have a good response, Mr GenreAuthority ;D.EDIT: holy shit htat was like 800x longer than i intended, i apologize for that	dubstep	1313495642
Just to say, I do like a lot of "dubstep 2.0" I got into this whole thing because of Datsik and Excision back in 2008 or so. I love those robot synths and the aggression behind it (i used to listen to a lot of industrial and metal as well). Tunes like Swagga, 3vil Nine, Subsonic were just fucking brutal. I'm not saying that the new direction of (lets be honest) neutered dubstep means that we should kick those people out of the genre. If Excision decides to collab with T-pain, well then he can certainly do that. That doesn't mean that I should respect his decision or direction. A lot of new dubstep is missing what made it great in the first place: the atmosphere. I can't tell you how many times I would listen to the intro, then the bass dropped and i would kill my sound in disgust. A lot of these new producers have absolutely no idea where the genre came from and as a result are disregarding what makes it good. It gets called as brostep or tearout, but obviously those names don't stick because most people just don't give a fuck. **tldr**: I guess my overarching point is that I understand the genre is evolving, I understand that people are taking it into unexpected and sometimes unwanted directions, I know that there are good things that come from it, and that people can listen to whatever they want. But that doesn't mean I have to like it, and doesn't mean that I can't criticize and try and do something about it. I see some good trends emerging in that more and more people are exposed to the genre for extended periods of time and after a while start to say "Hey this shit does sound all the same. When was the last time skrillex changed his patches? why do these DJs suck" and then the journey of exploration back in time begins. 	dubstep	1313537583

fucking a.Sometimes he makes dubstep that is nothing like what dubstep is known for or (in some peoples minds) it should be.He makes electro house, sometimes with a dubstep beat, in which case it is considered dubstep. discussion dismissedI'm a little peeved because this topic comes up nearly every other day and always has the chorus of "omg y do ppl h8 skrillex"	dubstep	1313887342

I think a reduced spawn time would be great. Nothing blows more than waiting 22 seconds while your sentries get sapped... then getting shot by a sniper, then running into an uber. 	tf2	1313990124
I understand this, but what does "breaking the game" mean?That it's completely unplayable? I have a bunch of insta-respawn servers i frequent and they are NEVER as bad as r/tf2 makes them out to be. They always end up balancing out, and with proper communication and teamwork it is easy to take any point out.I don't like 22 second respawns because it's just not fun for me. When you keep dying from more or less random reasons it doesn't exactly invite you to keep playing.I also don't understand why reddit hates crits. Why should random chance be taken completely out of the game?that's a separate discussion however 	tf2	1313991701
But it's POSSIBLE to get past that. You can get a team of five including 2 medics and easily take over 2fort. As long as you are well coordinated, it just doesn't matter. It's no more difficult than turbine. But again, I don't actually CTF when i play on 2fort.I guess i see your point with instarespawn as far as the intent with which you try to play with. If you're just having fun, then yeah it's a blast... otherwise not so muchI just think they get some undeserved hate. If you don't like them, there is simply no reason to even look at those servers, so there's no need flaming them whenever they are mentioned.	tf2	1313995390

because a lot of songs he makes aren't fucking dubstep and don't belong here This subreddit isn't dying. It gets an average of 100 subs a week (very conservative estimate) and 90 of those 100 people use it to post Cracks, Scary Monsters, and *latest video game dubstep remix*	dubstep	1314047042
strangely, i do not mind seeing this song be reposted. 	dubstep	1314047198
kind of. In theory it's supposed to see what spam sites get submitted and filters them out. It does that, but the problem is that to remove things we have to put them in the spam filter, so a lot of stuff from imgur, youtube, soundcloud etc gets caught in there and people usually pm us if they think their link got eaten up. I check it sometimes to get dubstep music out (not as much mercy to fry memes or rage comics), but keeping up with it is a pain so personally I hope people send messages. To answer your question more specifically, no. It's not approved content only. 	dubstep	1314048413
personally i'm a bit skeptical on removing really popular posts, *sometimes* there is some discussion that happens that helps people move past whatever it is they are bitching about this time... but I see your point.It's fairly obvious now that we just can't reconcile all the different opinions about skrillex, so the best thing would be to just avoid it completely.Im gonna start removing threads like this in the future 	dubstep	1314049162
post all of those now	dubstep	1314060253
Because they are electro house. The beat structure is at ~130bpm full time.Dubstep is 140bpm half time, which is where the -step comes in.Dubstep relies primarily on atmosphere and rolling basslines.	dubstep	1314060331
just putting this out here...I will be removing all topics pertaining to bitching about skrillex, bitching about the bitching about skrillex, bitching about 'hipsters' bitching about skrillex, bitching about people bitching about the hipsters, bitching about brostep, and just overall bitching in general.If you don't like what's on the front page, **submit more fking links**.

nah brah. Rusko is dubstep. Skrillex makes *some* dubstep tunes. For the most part he makes electro-house/complextro, which get wrongly posted here because some people just dont know what they're doing.It's not the "Style" of song, its the beat structure. Its not an opinion either, there is a literal difference in the song structure.Now, if you had a bad experience with Youngman, i dunno what to tell you, (im not the biggest fan of him either). If you're saying you dont like the kick/snare formula, well I dont know why youre even here because quite literally every electronic music tune follows that formula, especially dubstep since it is all syncopated around the beat. If you don't like the mellower tracks, thats fine, you should tune in to some datsik or SPL or downlink or Distance or whatever.	dubstep	1314068391

yes we should. However we can't fix that by starting up a new topic every week of "i hate skrillex" or "why do ppl h8 skrillex?!"Best way to do that is to promote awesome music, ive been trying to do that by starting up the podcast and flooding the page here every once in a while with tunes, but im running out of ideas now =\EDIT: don't get me wrong, i hate most of the stuff that people think passes for dubstep here, and I'd be damned if i moved to another subreddit just because of that. Its just that it is wasting bandwidth to try and argue about skrillex at this point so its best to just avoid the headache	dubstep	1314076905
we are definitely not at war, I love you guys.In fact, I wish more of you would post in r/dubstep! Best way to get people to appreciate what dubstep is all about is to expose them to the music that we found great in the first place. Most people come in expecting electro-type stuff, but maybe they'll stay when they see what the rest of the genre is all about. Diversity is the spice of life eh?Hope to see more great stuff here!Also: you guys should join the IRC! All/most of us are big bassheads, and redditors as well. It'd be great to have more dubstep oriented people around. 	realdubstep	1314091920

It seems that people are starting to finally get sick of the gimmick "dubstep remixes" and people trying to make "da filthy wobbulz/drop". I'm seeing lots of comments on otherwise popular tracks debating whether or not the artist actually has anything else up their sleeve or they are just trying to ride a trend.Hopefully people will go back to see why people like Dubstep in the first place (for me, the atmosphere, rolling basslines), and try to implement that and take it into new directions rather than just trying to get hits on youtube. 	dubstep	1314263815

yeah, i just wasn't too thrilled at all the tunes that have come out of that.

youre the one being a prick. Music isn't some random noises that hippies made up. There is a structure to every genre and every type of music, even ambient noise-drone corestep. EDM has a very rigorous structure that ALL artists conform to (if they ever want to be played out at least). Skrillex, Flux Pavillion, whatever dubstep artists you like all conform to that structure.It's not arbitrary. There are guidelines that contain dubstep and separate it from drum and bass, and drumstep, and electro, and that is NOT A MATTER OF OPINION	dubstep	1314854125
this is still here because bioquark actually typed up a rather informative post that people will see when they open this.banning this shit later though 	dubstep	1314854165
It's the opposite. "non-chill" dubstep needs to be differentiated from Dubstep instead of the other way around	dubstep	1314935565
but it is that way. mrcrunkswagga could have just posted the tune here without "chillstep" and it still would have gotten upvotes because it's a good tune and features prominent producers.Believe it or not, not everyone here is only upvoting "latest UKF bangers"	dubstep	1314937315

I, as well, see your point, but dubstep is all about the bass. Most tunes will (and should) sound neutered and hollow when played on a speaker with absolutely no low end whatsoever. Granted, I had Cockney Thug as my alarm tone for a while (WAKE THE FUCK UP), but it still just sounded... off	dubstep	1315026578
and we're in the top 2 comments and someone decided to start bitching about other people maybe starting to have this argument.Really dude? You're part of the problem. What are you trying to prove here? That people have opinions and are willing to defend them?	dubstep	1315081807
I'm sorry but I'm going to remove this thread.I thought we all agreed to not complain about other people complaining. This subreddit is meant for Dubstep and dubstep related things, not drum n bass, not electro, not drumstep, there are dedicated communities for that already.Music is not subjective, there is a clear and distinct difference between Dubstep and DnB, electro, etc, and if you don't care about it that does not mean other people don't either. If you're talking about people complaining about the types of other dubstep... well, that's just how it goes, both sides get enough love on here, seriously no use trying to say that someone is going to hurt Skrillex's feelings :P	dubstep	1315082059
Dubstep allstars is pretty good, 8 is my fav (&lt;3 Distance)Ministry Of Sound puts one out every once in a while... but they are always seriously late to the party by about a year.

r/realdubstep used to be cool but all I see now is a circlejerk. You can't post anything not made by an established artist there, or anyone even remotely midrange.I'm down with representing the original sound, not down with "oh this is BROSTEP. DOWNVOTED"Guess what, I have Downlink and Von D in the same playlist, and they are both talented and respected artists, and yet only one is considered "real dubstep"?	dubstep	1315285738
http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/search?q=brostep&amp;restrict_sr=on	dubstep	1315285869
I understand what you are saying, but I submitted a Downlink &amp; Datsik tune (against the machines), which is definitely NOT poorly produced or attempting to bandwagon or any of those things, and I got comments like "this belongs in r/dubstep" and it was just downvoted.Maybe "circlejerk" was too extreme of a word for this case, but I know for a fact the people there wouldn't appreciate stuff like SPL, Balkansky,  Culprate, Current Value, or any of the heavy dark stuff.This brings me back to a few months ago before this place blew up with Skrillex and all those electro producers, where people would argue that SPL, Downlink, etc were not "real" dubstep but were just brostep. As far as I'm concerned, there's enough of the original elements in their songs, as well as "bass, pace, and space" to have it be considered an awesome evolution of the original sound.	dubstep	1315302205
where the fuck did this comment come from?Nobody mentioned skrillex.I'm starting to think you guys LIKE being offended	dubstep	1315302355

love it, but i have no idea why he thought having Messinian saying random shit was a good idea...	dubstep	1315345843
I think he's a case of a relatively unknown producer trying to stay relevant. His last.fm bio pinned him as a jungle producer (i think), who switched to making music like this.Obviously the midrange happened then, and I guess he's been trying to head in that direction, which is unfortunate. 	realdubstep	1315346059

because it's the same reason this is related to dubstep.Burial is a rather popular producer that a lot of people here listen to, and this is the art from one of his albums. Although he's mainly classified as future garage, his songs have elements of dubstep in them (before the whole "listen to the drop, bro" thing happened). He's also a fucking awesome producer and makes some amazing musicI made the mistake of assuming everyone on reddit has the same mindset, so my bad about the skrillex comment. 	dubstep	1315432760
this is fucking cool, makes me feel extremely incompetent as a dj 	dubstep	1315432947

is there anything wrong with that? I've been listening to dubstep (and been in here) for quite some time now and this new trend of electro-bangers is kind of annoying, especially because everyone now seems to think that's what dubstep "is all about" 	dubstep	1315529429
My am views aren't "stop liking what i don't like". Did you read my comment? Did you see the part where I said "everyone who listens to skrillex is dumb and should stop listening to him" because I never said that.I'm making a comment about a trend in the music that I enjoy listening to, hoping to influence others to see my side of things. Dubstep is becoming more and more as simply just a bandwagon for producers to try and become famous, and I hate to see that.You're basically saying "oh you don't like the way things are going? why don't you just leave". 	dubstep	1315534982
Seeing as how this is r/darkstep I thought you guys would be more aware of this.there's plenty of darkstep producers turning out insane dubstep tracks (SPL, Counterstrike, Current Value, Dead Rodell, etc) It has fantastic production, and it is definitely not trying to sell to raving high school kids.I like posting some of that kind of stuff in r/dubstep but i guess it's too evil for some people.[But I think I will let this EP speak for me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTrzNQlEUK4)	darkstep	1315535382
You may be right. I don't really know of SubVibe or what he's all about, so perhaps my comment was badly placed. I would hate to knock on another producers method of production just because it's a popular trend. It's just that since this style is becoming popular, more and more people are trying to make it as well in order to gain popularity.I guess my problem, "rage" would be towards those who are simply trying to copy an artists style in an effort to market themselves. Props for the reasonable post. 	dubstep	1315540788
Watch this post get 100+ upvotes EDIT: well that didn't take long	dubstep	1315540967
Allow me to explain why.If the track gets released, every DJ ever will be able to play it. If it is kept in teaser form you will HAVE to see the producer live in order to hear the tune. It's not for you, it's for everyone else to get hyped up over the tune.Also, it takes MONTHS for a tune to hit release after it gets sent in to the labels, and there is nothing that can be done to speed up that process.You say that they will "lose relevancy in the community" but this simply isn't true, because the people doing it are moving units and selling shows, and have MANY more tracks that are being released while continually taunting you with the one that will never end up on anyone's ipod, or any other DJs decks. It's all about creating exclusivity. 	dubstep	1315548304

You really think this is true? In every popular subreddit there are people wishing for things to "go back the way they were", from the overuse of "herp derp le" in rage comics, to the memes and reposts in r/pics. And yet we are the hipsters here?It's not that everyone hates Skrillex so much, its just that because he was the one made dubstep super popular and accessible. There's been a serious drop in quality submissions since then. There's an amazing amount of "hey im too lazy to look for music myself, show me some good artists to torrent" and "i just pirated fruity loops, here's 30 seconds of me fucking around with the LFO" type submissions. As someone already mentioned in this thread, all the people who used to contribute good content here have left already because they're tired of this. To contribute to your analogy, this is the r/trees to what r/marijuana used to be. Nonsensical rage comics, "LOL GUYS IM SOOO HIGH", and "legalize it!11"If that's what you're into fine, but don't act surprised when other people are annoyed by it.-pretty much the last rant from me as well, so you can all go back to your filthy drops. 	dubstep	1315607300

Yes it really is...you seriously can't be bothered to search for a tune that you would like to buy or download? Maybe you shouldn't be listening to it then. It's such a fickle problem I can't believe you're even bringing it up.	dubstep	1315621163
I read this as "I don't care about the song if there isn't an obvious link to download it". Yeah there are some cases where it's a dubplate that you CAN'T have access to, but more often than not it's available on beatport or itunes or amazon, or hell even rapidshare. I'm sorry but this seems like a firstworldproblem sort of deal 	dubstep	1315621863
People hate skrillex not because of him himself or his music, but because he is essentially the reason everyone jumped onto dubstep. It was making it's way up with Rusko and such but then EVERYONE started listening to Skrillex so in their minds Skrillex became = Dubstep and that's what they knew of the genre.Then all of those people found this subreddit and began posting Flux pavillion tracks and Skrillex tracks because that's all they knew about the genre, not the previous artists like Mala, DMZ, Distance, etc. This new trend of electro also made other established artists change their production to keep up, so now we have a lot of people that sound exactly like the popular artists. Nobody would have a problem with Skrillex if he wasn't just so... engineered. 	dubstep	1315625600
i mean you say "bring it back" but truly it's all on you guys =\Yeah I can flood this place with tunes every other day, but that's just more trouble than it's worth. I just don't know what I could do as a moderator that would cause people to post more diverse content aside from just removing half of everything	dubstep	1315627785
Metal doesn't follow the same rules as EDM does though.Electronic DANCE Music has specified guidelines that it has to fit in to be considered to be in any given genre. I'm not saying it like there is a committee somewhere deciding this, but it helps a lot for DJs and producers and fans to generally know what they are getting into when someone says "I am going to play house/trance/electro/drum n bass" etc.Dubstep is just 140bpm half time snare with rolling basslines	dubstep	1315630049
yeah that's the one i was talking about. That remix is fantastic as well :D	realdubstep	1315630106
no problem, to be truthful, I dont know if there is anything established. I think this could reasonable go under electro or electro house since it follows that formula 	dubstep	1315631330

I have a question then. If LSD and psychedlics are so prone to exposing mental issues that people are unaware they have, shouldn't the best course of action be to NOT take them unless you've somehow gotten the "100% mentally stable" certification? I've done it before and can't really say I've benefited in any way other than learning that maybe you shouldn't fuck around with hard drugs. EDIT: why the FUCK am I being downvoted for asking this? Do you seriously believe that LSD is harmless and anyone should be able to try it EVEN if it's obvious that it can cause serious problems in people who never even knew it?	AskReddit	1315738198
I think it would be better for it to be Dubstep seeing as how we're r/dubstep and all, but it would be ok if you had half the tune be dubstep and then drop into drumstep in the 2nd drop 	dubstep	1315775319
if you want to, go for it, that account is where it should end up anyways at the end 	dubstep	1315775355
im just bringing up the fact that's its not as "harmless" as people make it out to be. there are obviously dangers with taking such a drug and I don't like people going around in threads saying "oh you should totally try LSD it's p cool it'll change your life bro" when in reality they should highlight the dangers and emphasize that if you THINK you may have some problems you are better off WITHOUT it.

heh, believe it or not, i &lt;3 all of it. This is more my type of stuff that I like listening to/blasting in cars. It may be considered brostep, but I really doubt any frat bros would be getting down to this kind of thing.Counterstrike are also a really sick darkstep/dnb duo, and I love seeing artists from other genres have a fresh take on dubstep.IMO this is the equivalent of Metal as far as Dubstep goes. Borgore/Shekel have terrible Screamo as their analogy, but this is straight up \m/ 	dubstep	1315775899
yup its them!	dubstep	1315775907
hm, anything goes really. Last few there has always been tracks that just have a lot of wobbles, but there is always someone doing something new and unique. I say just make the best track you can, whichever subcategory it falls under will just appeal to different audiences. I guess to answer your question, probably a decent amount of "brostep"  material gets submitted, but doesn't always make it to the end 	dubstep	1315777992
well youre probably the coolest frat bro I know of then! Sorry for the generalization there!I dont know about In Flames/Bodom then... haven't quite drawn the analogy that far yet. But let's go with [Black Sun Empire &amp; SPL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gofzmyf3vM&amp;hd=1)	dubstep	1315780706

I don't know about edge.I liked a few tracks, Ohh Nooo and Sexism really stood out. But I can't say I was a fan of the rest. To me, they just didn't seem that syncopated, and seemed a bit random.He's an amazing producer, great DJ, and runs a great label so I'm sure we'll see more stuff from him in the future. As a general comment though, it seems like a lot of producers that started out making heavy music are now making more and more "people friendly" tracks as a way to gain popularity. Obviously artists have to try and stay current, but it's just strange hearing something by SPL/Excision being played out of a teenage girls car (rough analogy).But, i could just be a dirty hipster :PI'm gonna keep blasting this for a week and see if it grows on me 	dubstep	1315895455

Allow me to requote something I posted on this subject. People hate skrillex not because of him himself or his music, but because he is essentially the reason everyone jumped onto dubstep. It was making it's way up with Rusko and such but then EVERYONE started listening to Skrillex so in their minds Skrillex became = Dubstep and that's what they knew of the genre.Then all of those people found this subreddit and began posting Flux pavillion tracks and Skrillex tracks because that's all they knew about the genre, not the previous artists like Mala, DMZ, Distance, etc.This new trend of electro also made other established artists change their production to keep up, so now we have a lot of people that sound exactly like the popular artists.Nobody would have a problem with Skrillex if he wasn't basically the beacon of everything some of us find wrong with this recent trend of music. Also, quite a few of his fans are fucking idiots.You can listen to him, fine. You can like him as a person, even better! But if you start dismissing the REST OF THE GENRE because "ugh, hipsters don't like change", then YOU are being the idiot. 	dubstep	1315986350
how am I being close minded? Did you even read what I said? Dude was wondering why people hated on Skrillex, I explained it pretty well. I never once claimed that "old dubstep is better". Maybe you need to stop assuming things.	dubstep	1316030805

Just because "real" dubstep doesn't smack you in the face with screeching electro synths and sporadic instrument changes does not mean that it "lacks energy". You are comparing Skream to Skrillex. That's like comparing Johnny Cash to Avenged Sevenfold and then saying Johnny Cash isn't "energetic" enough.For one, the intent is completely different. There are plenty of "real dubstep" that's just as dirty and energetic as all this electro without sacrificing the subbass and shuffle that made it dubstep in the first place.Nobody ever said that this electro-step is not going to start a party in the same way nobody is denying that Top 40 is what gets parties started. That doesn't mean the quality of music is any better than artists who are trying to write a good song instead of a 2 minute dancefloor rehash.Also, stop calling things "hipster". You're just throwing that word out there as if people are going to say "wow hey man, you're right". As a matter of fact, all of the people defending "Real dubstep" have been at it for way longer than the new influx of people who are just here because it's the latest thing. tl;dr: I thought we were going to stop talking about Skrillex. People need to accept that Dubstep is a diverse genre and constantly bitching about how people need to "accept the new wave" is like saying hip-hop fans should listen to t-pain because it's the "new trend". 	dubstep	1316381288
What's funny is that there are rarely every posts about why Skrillex/Borgore suck but there's a topic every 5 fucking minutes about "why does everyone h8 on skrillex"	dubstep	1316381561
So why can't we just keep it confined to the comments? Such posts most often get downvoted anyway, and hell, sometimes they do have some good points.If I wasn't a moderator, I wouldn't even visit this place anymore. All it is now is a "hipster-hating" circlejerk and an attempt for people to justify their tastes. Sometimes there are good discussions by people about the music, but more often than not they devolve into "ugh you're just a stupid hipster", and then people wonder why everyone hates Skrillex fans...	dubstep	1316383685
I'm just saying is that posts like yours really bug me. I've been at this subreddit for quite a while and this isn't anything new. People are always going to not like something for some reason. However, trying to call them out on it is not going to help any situation, especially when real content is displaced because of a topic that comes up every 3 days of "why don't you guys like ___ thing".Sometimes people have a background to go along with it though, like BioQuarks posts which try to inform people about the background of Dubstep, which is fine because he's just trying to educate people instead of telling them "you need to like ___ thing"	dubstep	1316391433

I'm sorry you feel that way.I think a lot of the "hipsters" etc are a little bitter that so many of the newcomers just don't even care about the older stuff, making comments such as "where's the drop?" on burial tracks...If you are really interested, there's the giant list of labels in the sidebar that offers many of the founding labels that push the sound out, also [bioquark typed up an epic post about the very first roots of where dubstep came out of](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/kb4i7/dubstep_education_1_the_roots_first_in_a_series/).I'm currently trying to figure out how to make a FAQ where we can address such issues and make it easy for everyone to get acquainted with the genre and maybe even appreciate it more. 	dubstep	1316664284

eh, it'd be a plus but I think knowing what dubstep is about beyond what the charts say and what gets posted on facebook is equally if not more important.I only vaguely know the history, and i have probably more Dubtek, SPL, and Rottun than deep medi, dmz, etc 	dubstep	1317180272
You have a point, but FL Studio DOES have a sound because of it's default compressor and the samples it has. It is very distinct and you can hear it if you hear enough tracks that came out of it that didn't bother messing with the master. 	dubstep	1317189322
I want to say that you shouldn't look at it as "I must listen to less bastardized versions of dubstep", but rather as you should take a look at where the genre started and the vibe it was originally all about.I think that Dubstep can still be "heavy" without resorting to ridiculous vocal hooks, synth, and screeching lead lines. It just seems that it's become way more pop oriented now, at least, well, the popular stuff is.	dubstep	1317239839

it just isn't the definition of "subtle". Those are all elements taken from popular electro/house music, whereas dubstep was about atmosphere. Even the really heavy shit like Balkansky and SPL still have a lot of atmosphere in their tracks rather than having it be based on "hooks" 	dubstep	1317247440
Really sick album, I recommend it as well :D 	dubstep	1317247756
nobody is talking shit? I'm explaining why some people don't like the newer trend of dubstep. Why does that bother you so much? Some people go into a genre for one particular sound, then it suddenly blows up and gets taken to the surface and becomes commercialized. Personally, I think most of the "popular" dubstep is shit now. Crush On You is annoying and obnoxious, and not at all what I like listening to or why I started to like dubstep in the first place.I'm sorry that other people have an opinion and like expressing it, reasonably at that. It IS like hip-hop vs top 40 rap right now, and I'd like to see how many people could argue that top 40 is the pinnacle of musical expression. I'm not calling judgment, I specifically said "I think that...", you are not the only one who is allowed an opinion here 	dubstep	1317251971
we could start calling it hard dubstep and hope it catches on :P 	dubstep	1317252711
nobody is saying it's bad. It's just annoying that both sounds are grouped into the same name. It makes for a lot of frustrations.It's pretty easy to argue that "dubstep" is supposed to be "Deep dubstep", but then the other stuff has to go somewhere... "brostep" just sounds stupid, and nobody has any better ideas 	dubstep	1317252801
btw, calling anyone a "nazi" does not help your argument at all.It's a musical opinion, not genocide. Nobody is advocating the mass murder of people who listen to the radio (although who knows, maybe they have some points). It's just people who don't think the new trend of dubstep is in any way still "dubstep", it did evolve, but it also moved somewhere completely different and it still has the same name. 	dubstep	1317282518
I usually blame my keyboard, but now I'm hoping it's not a real issue 	DoesAnybodyElse	1317286307
you have to realize there are over 26,000 people here, all with a different view of what dubstep is.A lot of people were into it before it got all accessible and "dancy", and now they think the new trend sucks. Some people liked it when it got "dancy" and now think it's starting to suck.I mean, what do you want us to do? Every other day some guy makes a topic like this and says "yeah why are you all hating i love skrollex!" and just perpetuates the issue. Then someone tries to explain what dubstep was "all about" and people say "oh youre just a stupid hipster dont tell me about dubstep"	dubstep	1317327504
yeah it was hard to choose 3 people while remaining unbiased to those we already knew, but we discussed it and chose them. Not to say the rest of the people were "unqualified" in any way, you guys are all awesome and I hope you keep doing what you are doing 	dubstep	1317334749
It's just not that simple anymore though. Lots of tunes get submitted here for the likes of Zomboy and Nero that are just, well, pop songs with a 2-step beat. The people who got into that think that's what dubstep is because nobody ever bothered classifying it as anything different. I'm not saying it's "bad" (even though I personally think its garbage), but it's easy to see where the issues come in.That and there's always the vocal minority on both sides who just like to complain about things regardless of how happy everyone else is.I think we're doing pretty good now... there's plenty of tunes being submitted and for the most part nobody is complaining... except for you sir &gt;:P	dubstep	1317335419
see but then you have to define what "crap music" is, and somone ALWAYS gets upset because "nah bro sometimes you just need to bro out y are you a hipster".Best way to handle the problem is to just keep posting good shit and educate people and maybe the ones that stick around and actually open their mind are the ones that are worth the effort.A lot of reposts here are made by people who make them, subscribe, then never come back.	dubstep	1317338115

Because [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acOtpQLXHuc) is dubstep, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmRipxhPpfg) is dubstep, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=124VzSLy7d0) is dubstep, and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexCBJF_n-4) is also dubstepYou'll be hard pressed to find someone who likes all 4 of these, and yet they all go under the same name.That brings up lots of issues down the line. Sometimes things need to be put in boxes because it makes moving around easier. 	dubstep	1317357156
I disagree, I think Punk IS the same. That's why you also got Ska, Hardcore, whatever. Even classic rock is an umbrella and underneath most of the bands can get more specific.This is just a pain in the ass because someone is going to get pissed off no matter what. If there just existed some subgenres that made sense, it would work. DnB has liquid, neuro, darkstep, techstep, jump-up, lots of stuff.All we have is 'Dubstep' and "brostep" but good luck getting anyone to take that seriously =\	dubstep	1317357973

"Genre evolution" my ass. Real evolution doesn't get played on the radio. That "regeneration" documentary with skrillex, pretty lights, country shit, the doors, etc really got to me because people are claiming its "evolution".

I don't really get why you're noting that Skrillex wasn't listed... maybe he just isn't "god tier"?Nobody listed Vex'd or Balkansky either for that matter.Also, I'm finding a lot of problems with your list, mainly that you basically took what equates to the most popular tracks from the past year and a half and put them in a list... just because something is popular does not denote it is good. Just because something is new most definitely does not entail that it is better.Just putting that out there, I'm not trying to incite a flame war or live up to my flair, I'm pointing something out. 	dubstep	1318130127

Cool idea, but the drop just sounded like a clusterfuck of synths to me =\	dubstep	1318322093
This is a great tune. The synths are awesome, and there's basically a "keyboard solo" imbedded.However, I can see how anyone with a knowledge of the background of dubstep wouldn't think this is Dubstep. Other than the 140bpm half time beat (barely, because there are so many breaks), it really shares nothing in common with [Dubstep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeDXyU2PWB8).I'm not saying anything about the quality of the tune at all, I am merely remarking that it's such a far offshoot from the genre a year ago that it can be barely be considered to be a part of it. 	dubstep	1318322342

you really need to go up and down this thread then. That album has maybe 1 or 2 dubstep tracks on it. Excisions previous singles were much better IMO	dubstep	1318559954
wtf kind of question is that?He programs his drums using various samples? There isn't any "pack" any reasonable producer uses... you just look for samples. You steal them from metal tracks, you steal snares from punk and other metal...Just look for it dude. Don't try to sound like borgore, make your own sound, find your own samples.	dubstep	1318566177
To be more helpful... look into drum rack in Ableton. You can load up samples in there, stack them, and trigger them via MIDI.I recommend getting a sample pack of sounds somewhere, it really is the easiest and best way to go about making drums. Although it's a bit difficult to get them to sound alive (you have to tweak velocity and swing to really get them to sound good), it's a very hands-on approach and leaves you with a lot of control over the sound.I don't THINK he uses Ableton anyway, so he might just trigger samples via Battery like you said. Either way, drums are generally sample based so you can't go wrong with 1gb of drum hits. 	dubstep	1318568641
well, to one-up myself again, you should stick some effects on the return tracks in drum rack. Cabinet and the Saturator in ableton help a lot towards getting kicks to sound gritty and kind of distorted. I put a guitar AMP vst on them once and it really sounded brutal.Layering kicks with the Ableton 808s also helps a lot, since those pack a lot of srs bass. 	dubstep	1318570623
yeah I just use hat samples from my library of stuff i've downloaded over the years. Sometimes it's cool to just go through winamp and pick out drum hits from songs I think sound nice.Reverb + delay goes a lot way towards making hats sound spacey and awesome, don't really use Toms though. Personally I don't like using the stock ableton samples because I figure everyone else has access to them and I kind of want to distance myself from sounding too generic as a result of that. Nothing's worse than listening to a tune and saying "hey.. i know exactly where that sound came from, and i know what you did to it"	dubstep	1318571200

However, if you fail the class, that's your fault. Also, for the most part, you can select classes that you would be interested in, and because you have an interest in the subject, the classwork isn't as difficult because you enjoy it.You really have to figure out your strengths.

Set Me on Fire was on their latest album where they made one of EVERY song, including Metal, Electro, (actual) DnB, Linkin Park rock, and what might as well be trance.

Say what you will about "experimenting", but when a DnB group that goes from [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_Wj02bM3Js&amp;hd=1) to touring with Linkin Park, then splitting into electro and [back into dnb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9opKErsw7U) you have to question their reasons for doing so.

You know, I'm sure that 80% of "depressed" people on reddit are only depressed because of shitty lifestyle decisions (hint, staying up late, being on reddit, doing nothing productive, smoking weed 24/7), not because they "suffer from depression and you don't get it".EDIT: of course, it's much easier to shift the blame on a disorder than to do something about it yourself.

and how is that?	pics	1318800700
How can I possibly be completely wrong? Bad lifestyle decisions do lead to depression. Believe it or not, hitting the gym, and making progress in areas that are important to you do alleviate your mood and make you feel better about your life. Everybody has ups and downs in their life, just because you are stuck in a low point does not necessarily mean you are depressed, it just means that, well, things are going your way, and that's completely fine. What is NOT fine is saying "oh yeah, im clinically depressed" when all you do is sit around browsing reddit rather than taking action. I perfectly understand that THIS IS NOT THE CASE for some people. Some people DO feel depressed and hopeless no matter what, in which case, yes it is a problem. But that does not apply to everyone.Just like I could safely say 1 in 3 people have symptoms of ADD does not mean they need adderall to focus, it usually means they should stop being fucking lazy and do their work instead of making up excuses. 	pics	1318802477
I'm not denying that. I feel that way sometimes too.However, a lot of the population on reddit is on reddit because it's a self fulfilling cycle. The more you stay inside the less interaction you get with people, the more anxiety you feel when you do.I'm likely depressed as well, but I'm tired of seeing these pity posts of "oh, people just don't understand depression" because if you're submitting fucking comics on reddit about how depressed you are, that's obviously not going to help anyone. Pessimism breeds pessimism. I'm not attacking you in particular, but I am CERTAIN that there are TONS of people on here who are probably between the ages of 16-22 and self diagnosed themselves with depression because they are tied to the computer all day.I KNOW that myself spending so much time on the internet, IRC, and this website has affected my anxiety levels out "in the real world". That doesn't mean I was born that way, it just means that my habits have influenced my life and I need to take responsibility for it.To make this more general, reddit has a habit of oursourcing responsibility. "Women are dumb" "bros are stupid" "it's not my fault, it's the 1% keeping me down". Sometimes one should just assess their own life and realize that maybe their lack of success is brought on by their own perception of the world, not the worlds influence on them.tl;dr: Yes, some people are depressed, and that is unfortunate, however, there are many people who just THINK they are depressed because they don't want to take responsibility for themselves. EDIT: Maybe if you changed your attitude and instead of being a dickhead on the internet, you'd feel a little better. Calling people "Retarded" and "wrong" for having an opposing point of view isn't going to get you anywhere 	pics	1318808926

Lots lots lots lots of resampling and effects. If you're looking at anything from Rottun (Downlink, Datsik, etc), they resample like their life depended on it.There is no easy answer to your question unfortunately (and find your own sound ;D). I've had good results with granular synthesis ([results in this tune](http://soundcloud.com/resykle/devastator-wip)), but it still takes a lot of effects.To explain granular sampling, grab a machine noise. Chainsaw, hydralic lift, anything. Then stretch it, and apply effects. Record this. Stretch, apply effects again. Record this. Repeat until you have an abomination, then apply some filters, automate, and you'll have something interesting.The hardest part IMO is keeping track of where your sound is headed.Also, bandreject filters will help you get a high pitched mechanical sound, but as always, there is no generic answer so you'll have to play around with what you have.Sorry if this post rambled on, i'm really drunk and spent all of today making robot noises, so I'm quite used to the process ;)lemme know if you need any more pointers, maybe I'll remain friendly tomorrow, and i love talking about production anyway 	dubstep	1318842538

Nope, if anything, I kind of look down upon it. I'd rather see an amazing track by someone who has spent decades and years working on music as an expression rather than some kid who made an electro tune or a pokemon remix. When I see "13 year old made this track" I think of the average 13 year old... and let's be honest, 13 year olds are idiots. You were an idiot when you were 13, and I was an idiot when I was 13... so that doesn't really set a good precedent..."check out this track made by a guy who is the same age that you were when you listened to limp bizkit, thought beer was nasty, thought it was acceptable to call things 'gay' and didn't listen to your parents"whole new meaning there 	dubstep	1318904979

It still affects one's perception of it. I'm tired of hearing about him at this point, because every time he takes a dump on a keyboard it ends up on the front page here with 500 people arguing over whether he is jesus or satan.Dubstep never needed "more fans". The genre was founded upon doing something different and making it for the love of music and culture. If anything he's showed everyone that you can make a ton of money and fame from it. Besides, his rendition of Dubstep was always a fusion of electro and such, which, although nice and different, has turned the genre into a clusterfuck as everyone and their grandmother listens to slightly different dubstep and can't agree on what to call any of it. 	dubstep	1319138694

Where is this "wob wob" bullshit coming from?Dubstep has NOTHING to do with the annoying LFO sound.Dubstep is about sub-bass basslines, a 2-step beat, and 140bpm.

I don't think you understand. I'm not making this up, I'm summarizing what 6 years of a genre have been like. DUBSTEP IS ABOUT BASS. I don't care how many mid range lines or key arps, or growls, or yells, or whatever Skrillex, Calverton, Nero put in their tracks. Dubstep will always be about sub-bass frequencies. Despite a lot of popular songs having no bass at all, there are tons of artists that are still keeping in touch with where we started out.by the way, there's a small chance that mods become mods because they know a thing or two about what they are moderating 	dubstep	1319940400

thanks :DAs much as I love the electro bangers, I honesty think that the deeper/bassier dubstep is a better place to start. It honestly does take a lot of effort to make a song contain so much power, yet have so much of it be unheard. Producers like Kryptic Minds use a lot of production tricks that are nearly inaudible but can really go a long way towards creating an atmosphere in their tracks.All you really have to do is slow down and listen to it :D	dubstep	1319946129
I'm sorry but I disagree.Dubstep isn't a matter of opinion. Although there is obviously a huge variety of styles and influences, it's pretty easy to point out if something is dubstep or not.Most electronic dance music is broken down to a beat structure, and it has to be. If it wasn't, DJs wouldn't mix it, and if DJs don't mix dance music... well then it's something completely different.What tends to happen is a style would start to gain traction, then it would become a subgenre of whatever it came from (see: jumpup, drumstep, neurofunk, darkstep, liquid dnb, jungle etc)Sure, there are some producers that work without beatgrids and just make music (Burial), but for the most part, most set the BPM to 140, start off with a half-time snare, and start building from there to make a specific genre.I really wish people like feed me/calverton/nero/etc would start a moniker for their electro influenced Dubstep already so that the scene would stop being such a clusterfuck. I understand that most people aren't producers or DJs and don't really have an insight into the technical side of things, but this is the way it is.	dubstep	1319946507
Nah if i unfrontpage it stays on there for some reason, and the - doesn't work either. I'm trying to spend less time here as some of the opinions and thoughts I see flying around are beginning to infuriate me, coming from both of "brostep lovers" and "hipsters" :P	dubstep	1320011107
Downlink delivers! This would be such a sick track to drop live	dubstep	1320011850
You're right, this really isn't that impressive.However, Downlink is really good at creating a massive basslines that really DRIVES the beat. This is one of those songs that you have to play LOUD. Get into a car with a good system, or go to a show, and I think it would sound great there. Not only that, but having a DJ mix it into something else after the initial drop would help to mix it up even more. 	dubstep	1320011917

Oh i guess it's legit then.Seems like a good start, but I swear if he starts hating on everything that's not from 2005 it will be garbage.I understand that people don't like brostep, but you can't possibly say that the influence DnB/Neurofunk/Darkstep and glitch have had on dubstep is negligible.I'm not talking about the pop-y electro stuff, but the real terrifying stuff influenced by darkstep. Why is it so hard to find a middle ground between Mala and Current Value is beyond me. Early datsik/excision stuff was great, and still had a remnant of dubstep culture in it. 	dubstep	1320188365

Well, you're right.I resent your Pendulum comment because they are definitely capable of making good music, they just choose to make popular shit (probably because of Rob Swire...). I saw them live after In Silico came out and it was easily one of the best live experiences i've ever had. Also, Ransom was an excellent tune and it came out recently.I'm just sayin that it seems like the author is going to go on and say "And yeah and then brostep came along and everything was shitty and only Skream and DMZ kept it real" which is very counterproductive.I agree with you that anything made with the purpose of being "da sick club tune" isn't necessarily pushing any boundries, but stuff like Culprate, Balkansky, SPL, Tech Itch, Hecq, Nit Grit even is infact seriously bending the genre into new places.I guess we're really on the same page here, I just hope that this guide doesn't attempt to shun every influence that has hit dubstep since 2006.	dubstep	1320216018

Most people don't give a fuck. They'd rather keep listening to every new tune Skrillex/Feed Me/Deadmau5/**popular artist** put out instead of looking deeper into the genre or seeking out artists further down the grapevine. 	dubstep	1320264631
I used to think it was ok, but then I started to look into community HUDs and have since adapted a lot of parts from them. Right now I'm using the [health, ammo, and scoreboard from oxide HUD](http://ben.clnsky.com/tf2hud/), and a few elements from the Community HUD.The placement of the Health/Ammo is very cool, easy to see, and has really helped me. The only problem is that the HUD is no longer updated, so many things like being able to see the weapon of the person who killed you, or being able to cycle through and view teammates weapons are not available. 	tf2	1320266392
the point was that there are more artists out there, he's not only including  "real" dubstep, but everything else as well.	dubstep	1320271520
I agree with you. My point wasn't that they are bad, but that most people don't look past them. Deadmau5 is the epitome of popular EDM next to david guetta and such.Of course Feed Me is a great producer, he's Spor... he's made Neurofunk which IMO is way more complicated than electro/dubstep.It's just annoying seeing everything Skrillex/Feed me have ever done get posted/reposted here as if people don't even bother listening to music that's not on UKF. EDIT: So much for the "consider offering a comment instead of downvoting", you twats :P	dubstep	1320271697
Stop being such a twat in every post that doesn't say anything positive about skrillex.I'm answering Nutrilait's statement of "why not introduce new people to stuff you prefer". So yes, it is my problem because I want to introduce people to music I think is good?Most people honestly don't care who makes their music as long as they can get fucked up and grind on girls with it, and then there are some that do. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with either attitude, but that's just the way it is	dubstep	1320273510

Why wouldn't I? he's popular and is the first step many people take towards Dubstep. He's been relevant for quite some time now as well. The point is that he's popular and some people don't have any desire to look for artists further down the grapevine. 	dubstep	1320287316
that's an oddly specific jump...Have you considered he's referring to [people who model their lives after this](http://theofficialpageof.com/wp-content/uploads/mike-the-situation.jpg)?	dubstep	1320296207
Hardly "far"... Most of the frat bros I know watch that shoe religiously 	dubstep	1320308453
There isn't anything wrong with that. The thing is that dubstep is catching on with the same type of people that like David guetta, akon, tiesto, chart topping hits. Most of those people aren't looking for music beyond what is played at the clubs, which is my point. 	dubstep	1320308605

He's really the entity that everyone directed their anger towards as Dubstep took leaps away from where it started into the mainstream.He was also marketed pretty damn well, seeing as how he blew up practically overnight and without any real reason...Really, the way I see it, Skrillex is a 30 pack of cheap beer; great for parties, great for beer pong, etc, but doesn't focus too much on taste or depth unlike the type of Dubstep not being made for clubs or arenas.my 2 cents. Unfortunately for you, this topic will probaby not see the light of day as I'm trying to drastically reduce the amount of rage in this subreddit...	dubstep	1320315298

Look i under you're all high and mighty about the classic dub sound but how the hell can you diss Nit Grit?Dude started out in his own style. It's obviously not like classic dubstep but I don't see how you can possibly call him "pop/brostep" when he's obviously never hit any charts. He makes glitchy, well produced tunes that are obviously a far cry from where the genre started out, but THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS BAD.How can you give Eskmo any credit but not nit grit/antiserum is beyond me. Especially with fucking tunes like [skullfucked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B23DQbFM-zw) and [goddamn california style](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3c_Jr17iMI)which reminds i've forgotten all about Babylon System!

I don't believe that he's making tunes with "mindless wobbles" because he wants to hit UKF, but rather because **he likes doing that**. Besides, apparently he mixes uk funky at some of his shows... so it's not like he doesn't know where dubstep came from, he just wants to do something else with it 	dubstep	1320992729
I think thats why you don't have as much of an appreciation to the technicalities behind some of this music. It takes immense effort to get a track to sound that way, as well as program synths, leads, pads, stabs, etc...	dubstep	1320992793
oh right, good one. Isn't martyparty from around here too?Again, I think there's a big combination of glitch and dubstep/breakbeats here. Even bassnectar started out with that (Underground Communication &lt;3)	dubstep	1320993816
I think it comes down to the percussion and atmosphere of the track. If it is based heavily around the lead rather than the rhythm then it is usually trying to make the song a "hook" with a melody that gets stuck in your head.Benga/Emalkay/16bit all have some (no other word for it) filthy tunes, but they still have a wicked rhythm section behind it. The thing with skrillex/all those electro artists making "dubstep" is that they disregard that. They just have a half time beat with some random hi-hats and that is as far as the rhythm goes, because in electro it doesn't really matter what's going on in the back. 	dubstep	1320994039

I'm sorry to break this but there is no such thing as "cheap CDJs". DJ gear is notoriously expensive as FUCK, mostly because you're paying for durability and audio quality.$500 will net you 1 CDJ if you're lucky. Gemini is coming out/has come out with some CDJ-700s that are reportedly great for the price (~$600 each), but again, it's not cheap.You could consider getting a digital controller and using that to control software, but the limitation with that is you're essentially learning how to walk by using a crutch. To learn how to properly phrase/beatmatch you need to subject yourself to a difficult setup, but maybe not if you're willing to spend some time.I know you said "audiophile HQ stuff" but honestly you need to dish out for something that doesn't suck. A $300 controller will help you get started though. [I've heard great things about this thing](http://www.amazon.com/Hercules-DJ-4780474-Console-RMX/dp/B0018CEOA6)Just to share, [this is my setup on the left](http://i.imgur.com/TEg4P.jpg)2 Stanton t.60 turntables1 Behringer DDM4000 mixerand a laptop running TraktorThe turntables are second-hand, and they kind of blow, but they were only $200 and get the job done (they turn at more/less 33rpm :P)The mixer i got brand new, and it's really sick for the price ($400), but the VU meters are absolute shit and have led me to make annoying gain adjustments while i mix. 	dubstep	1321410123
Turntables are nearly always cheaper, even a pair of Technics is less than a pair of comparative CDJs. Thing is, mixing with only vinyl is difficult and vinyl itself is very expensive. If you can get CDJs, that would be the most optimal. If you can learn how to mix with CDs, you can mix with pretty much anything. Also, you would be able to show up to any place with CDJs and begin playing without any need to set up. Most new CDJs also allow you to use USB/SD cards as well, which helps with storage.Unfortunately, the more features you want, the more you'll have to dish out =\The most cost-effective option that I've found is to get 2 midrange turntables (Stanton STR8-80 would be my choice, but honestly anything direct drive will work) and control vinyls for software like Traktor/Serato.Serato is great and an industry standard, but it is expensive as FUCK. the software is free but you NEED the hardware to run it, which is something like $600 for an SL3 box (dunno how much used it is).Traktor is also pretty great, but they're trying to make it some sort of hybrid between live performance and mixing, so I don't know if that will impact future versions (although their soundcards are solid, I got the Audio 4 DJ + Traktor + vinyls for about $150)I suggest checking out craigslist for deals, as well as going to some music store that has DJ equipment up and messing around with it. It's all about what you feel comfortable with. I hated using controllers, but I loved the versatility of using a DVS as well as having a real mixer in front of me so I got my setup.sorry for the huge post heh, but I want to give all the information I can, because I used to be in your position as well. 	dubstep	1321420662

&gt; A person spinning on two turntables and DJ Icedawg playing a pre-recorded set on Virtual DJ can have the exact same set and the exact same reaction. Are you serious? If i find a DJ playing a prerecorded set I will personally do my best to make my way to the stage and punch them in the face. That's just disrespectful to the audience and everyone who paid to hear the mix.A DJs job is to introduce an audience to interesting music by creating a seamless mix and reading the crowd to decide where to take the mix next. Having a premade setlist is lazy at best.The end does not justify the means. If all you're doing is playing a prerecorded mix with 100% TOP CLUB BANGERS then you are no better than an ipod. 	dubstep	1321681691
There is a huge difference between embracing new technology and relying on it completely.Bro McGuy decided to become a DJ so he bought the cheapest controller he could find, pirated VirtualDJ and hits sync all day long as he sifts through his "Top 200 Dubstep tracks of 2010" collection he grabbed off of The Pirate Bay (In high quality 192kbps format, no less). He doesn't understand what "EQ" stands for or why the controller has jog wheels...vs.Joe McCoolDJdude started off small, but gradually built a setup and learned how to beatmatch, phrase match, and put together a good set. As he got better, he uses effects and hotcues to bring his set to a new level, eventually incorporating Ableton Live, an APC40, and loops to blend live performance with mixing.	dubstep	1321681900
Well to be fair, lugging around crates of vinyl is a pain in the ass.Most DJs use CDJs because it's really easy to bring a few CDs or USB drives of music. Serato/Traktor make it even easier, as all you have to do is bring your laptop with you and some control CDs/VinylIt's convenient really. Also, vinyl is expensive as hell and gets really messy to mix if you're in a hurry	dubstep	1321682028
That is essentially what I am describing in scenario 2.Yes, technology does allow more people to get into DJing, which is a rather abstract and difficult "instrument" to master.However, it is also the new guitar, by which I mean that people sometimes pick it up simply for the title and attention. Being able to hammer out a green day song, wonderwall, and 3 power chords has become being able to drop Woo Boost and David Guetta and hit sync.I'm not saying you shouldn't use technology. I started off with a pirated copy of VDJ, then got a controller + torq, and finally upgraded to my current setup of 2 turntables + DDM4000 mixer.I'm just hating on the people who want to be considered DJs, and start by asking questions like "what should my DJ name be" before even admitting that they can't mix without sync. 	dubstep	1321688176

This was.. surprisingly pleasant! I prepared myself for a clusterfuck of noise and sample-diarhea.. but this is an awesome tune.I'd love to drop it in a set!Now for criticism... I feel like your low-mid end is dominating the mix. The really low guitar/strings sound a bit muddy and could use some EQ just to turn it down a bit.

Pop doesn't push any innovation at all. That's the whole damn point of it: to be watered down and easily accessible. If you want innovation, go look for music made by artists who don't care about youtube hits, or "LIKE MY PAGE TO GET A FREE SONG', or remixing popular rap songs.Breakcore is innovative, IDM is innovative, Neurofunk is innovative, electrostep remakes are not. 	dubstep	1321992965

You're thinking of the glass being half empty.Instead of 99.9% of people not knowing who you are, you have an immeasurable impact on everyone you make contact with in your daily life. Your family, friends, co-workers all have you as part of their lives, and your life experience is unique only to you.Fuck what Fight Club said, you ARE a unique snowflake in that there is no single person like you in the rest of the world... potentially universe (let's leave some options open ;) )All that really matters is the things that you make matter. So find something that's important to you and stick to it. If you go about life thinking you don't matter, then guess what? You won't. All anyone really has is the hope that tomorrow will be a better day and that it will all be worth it in the end. Post: There are lots of people who worry a lot and claim depression and anxiety and other disorders as the problem in order to get drugs that they think will help them, because they probably think they're supposed to be happy 24/7. This isn't the case, life is difficult for everyone and being unsatisfied with yourself is part of the human condition. If you were fulfilled 24/7, well what would be the point of going further?

I think your beat needs to vary up more. Add more breaks and fills.Dubstep is really all about the beat, with the subbass line guiding it from kick to snare.

That's not necessarily true. The purpose of a company is to be whatever that company wants to be. All companies, hell, all PEOPLE want to make money because it is the only way they can sustain and improve their business.That does not make them soulless. I know lots of record labels (especially in the electronic music scene) that are there to promote and help artists as well as create a community and push a sound.They don't have "make tons of bank" on the agenda, and even the ones that do become successful do it because they enjoy what they do.Look at record companies that push out obscure and not-people-friendly music. I really doubt darkstep and industrial and powernoise record labels are there to "make a buck". There is plenty of room for compassion and love for music, that's why they exist in the first place.

You probably want to look into Logic. I hear lots of good things from people who have OS X and use it.First off, producing is hard. You are going to suck for a while unless you're some kind of one hit wonder (in which case I hate you). I suggest choosing a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, Logic or Ableton in your case), and then finding a powerful VST synth (akin to Massive or Albino 3) and learning the shit out of it with Youtube and various tutorials.You're probably going to start out with trying to recreate another artist which is a great step towards finding your own sound. Figuring out how to mix and synthesize is very important towards creating your own tracks.Find some bios of your favorite artists and find out what programs they use. This will help you get an idea of where you want to START.My emphasis is on START because if you continue to pursue production, you are going to eventually find what interests and works for you way better than any tutorial or post can tell you. It's a long journey, but nothing beats listening to a finished song at the end of a week or 3 of hard work, even if it sucks.Sorry for what i  hope is a moderately comprehensible rant (im drunk), and feel free to pm me producting questions. 	electronicmusic	1323338296

It's the same as being a metalhead amidst all the scene/emo kids who think metalcore and Job For A Cowboy is great music. My personal opinion is that 80% of the new dubstep tracks coming out aren't even trying anymore. Anything with a tiny bit of bass and 140bpm half-time snare is labeled as "dubstep" now and nobody gives a shit.The people who do still care are labeled as "hipsters" and "purists" as if some dear idea is being attacked here.So yeah, every time I mention I'm a dubstep DJ/producer and recieve the "oh so you like Skrillex and Deadmau5" response and blank looks at "no, like downlink, distance, and SPL" I'm becoming more convinced that the genre died and came back as something completely different	dubstep	1323489823

&gt; How about everybody stops trying to put the things they like in a little box labeled "good", and push everything else in a box labled "bad"?So.. you want people to stop having preferences? Sure, objectively all music is good and fine, but subjectively you are most definitely allowed to have a say and an opinion. If your opinion happens to be that certain music is garbage then you are perfectly allowed to think that.The problem here isn't taste, it's that most people know jack about EDM and don't take the slightest effort to educate themselves. You can like Skrillex and deadmau5, there's no problem with that. But understand that they are about as Dubstep as Justin Bieber is classic rock. 	dubstep	1323497048
You misunderstand. There are 2 points here: what is my opinion and what is (an arguable) fact. In fact, I never used either of those phrases, and you are assuming that *just because something isn't dubstep that means it is not good music*.I'm simply stating that quite a lot of new music being labeled as "dubstep" is inaccurate, and that is not what it should be called. It's like calling a Honda Civic a sports car, or saying that Coors Light is a classy beer. It's not really that difficult to make a distinction between J:Kenzo, Distance, and Mala and Skrillex, Mord Fustang, and Kill the Noise. Nor is it a bad thing!creation of subgenres is great because it helps a particular sound find a home and a distinctive community. You say "electro-house" and instantly everyone knows what you're talking about. But now you go to a "dubstep" station on pandora and lord knows what you'll find.My viewpoint is that the genre SHOULD splinter off. It's not likely to happen now unless every single dubstep listener reads this post and thinks its a good idea. That doesn't forbid me from expressing my viewpoint however. tl;dr: I'm not saying it's bad, even though personally I don't like it at all. I'm just saying that there is a clear distinction that nobody is paying attention to. 	dubstep	1323504678

I picked up an xbox 360 about... 5 years ago? It's been running every single game I've thrown at it since, I enjoy playing on it, and it's plugged into my computer monitor. Cost: $400, $60 a year for XBL, $60 per game.Compare that with having to pirate every game I might be interested in playing just to see if I can run it at something that looks decent, and I'd rather take the console option. I honestly don't see the point of gaming on a PC on low settings. My point is that stop trying assert this "PC superiority". Consoles and PC gaming both have a place in the world and it is useless to try to make one out to be better.Not everyone wants to jump on a $200 video card every 2 years. typical, downvoted for not HAIL PC in r/gaming	gaming	1324194356

good tune, i wish there was a name other than "brostep" that had caught on though... good looks for recognizing that it's different than what most people consider dubstep though 	dubstep	1324211125
Perhaps, but the connotation is that "brostep" is juvenile, overbearing, lacking of any originality, much like the "bros" accused of listening, and thus ruining it.  	dubstep	1324219639
I dont know what you're talking about, PC titles are still ~$60, and I already explained that I use my monitor. As far as specs go, I would never buy a PC so that I could play games on medium setting. Whats the point of you're not going to get the most out of the game? It seems unnecessary when I can just buy a disc, put it in, and not have to deal with any possibly hinderance.Also, why do you assume I don't get any of the benefits PCs have to offer? I have a 360 and a PC/laptop obviously, how else would I type this.I play Tf2 on my laptop because that's the only thing it can run decently, and I am in a financial position that lets me spend $60 for a game I will play for a long time, rather than $400 every once in so often to keep up with everyone else. 	gaming	1324250856

I can only speak for myself, but I don't hate brostep. I just recognize that there is a huge distinction between J:Kenzo, Distance and Doctor P. There's also the fact that artists like Mord Fustang don't make dubstep but instead use elements of the genre in their own music.You think that because I somehow missed this one track *of an artist I don't listen to to begin with* I'm out of touch? It's not really my type of music that's all 	dubstep	1324450087
Obviously my qualifications were good enough to put me in this position 	dubstep	1324460738
You need a subwoofer to hear subbass. Fact.Dubstep is a genre that revolves around subbass, another fact. I mentioned I had subwoofers which is why I made the thread, hardly pretentious... And yeah I have a stance on music that I don't like. You don't have to consider my opinion if you don't want to. Hardly calls for a personal attack Im not saying they are plebians... But you are seriously missing out on a very important part of the genre by not having a sub.I said its a waste if you think it is because if it's not important to you then you think it's dumb.I thought having a good system was a good investment.so it was worth it to me to spend that money and install it myself. I'm sorry you misjudged my comments 	dubstep	1324460993
That is logical, but to some the value of a good sound system is worth it. I'm simply stating that I'm glad i made the investment despite finances.	dubstep	1324463427

I've found that demos get spychecked more than anyone because they are the easiest class to disguise as after getting a kill(hit 4 twice).

He never sold out. He started off by being sold.It's no accident he's so popular today, especially when you take in his relationship with producers such as deadmau5. The guy starting off making popular, dancable music.There ISNT ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT. But to think that he's "pushing boundaries" is a bit naive. He's a great producer but he's also knows what he's doing and how to get up on charts	dubstep	1324811873

of course nothing can come close to the wonder that is neurofunk, but id say this isnt a bad dubstep version. It would be fun to drop in sets at least 	dubstep	1324866934
Eh, it's honestly just a different arrangement of the synths he always uses. Didn't seem that catchy at all honestly, at least compared to the other tracks 	dubstep	1324867056
dude calm down, just because he said he doesn't think its dubstep doesn't mean he's casting it aside or anything.It's seriously nothing like the original aesthetic of dubstep. Genre evolution, whatever, is fine but it's a completely different genre at this point. Skrillex isn't dubstep. He makes FINE music. It's dancable, popular, catchy, well produced.It's just not dubstep, and there's nothing wrong with that. 	dubstep	1324867281

Shitty offensive comments yes, but it's not the genre evolving. This is something completely different. I think it's healthy to have such discussions as that is the only way we will move forward.I maintain that this isn't dubstep. It's FINE. But it's just not dubstep. It's not even "excision/datsik/downlink/culprate" dubstep, it's just electro at a different bpm.Probably going to get downvoted by the skrillex fanboys now 	dubstep	1324940512

well, most people really don't give a fuck. They think it's dubstep and that's the end of it to them.Personally, I'm a DJ/Producer so I like talking about this kind of stuff for fun and for intellectual purposes. It really does make a lot of difference when you try to explain the type of music you want to play.I can say "I will mix dubstep tonight" and hooly shit that could seriously mean ANYTHING at this point.Saying, "I will mix electro" is a different category, but one that could feasibly include skrillex, mord fustang, etc as their sound is very similar. 	dubstep	1324949536

It didn't change. Older type dubstep is still alive and healthy, its just that people like you ignore it completely because of the vocal fanbase and the fact that you can't dance to it. 	dubstep	1326406204
So is going to Kid Rock, Nickelback, or any other band redditors tend to hate.Nobody is saying they don't PRODUCE well. The quality of a track goes beyond "being dancy"I like my music to have some soul and depth rather than BANGERBANGERBANGER... at least some of the time.	dubstep	1326439605
That's totally fine, so who are you calling a "dubstep hipster"?You know other people are allowed to have preferences too, and maybe they strongly believe that the newer sound is a bastardization of the original that tries to be outrageously commercial.Don't get me wrong, I love Downlink, counterstrike, spl, really heavy shit... but there's a clear distinction between music that just tries to be catchy and danceable and that which tries to push some boundaries and express itself. 	dubstep	1326442544

Let's take your analogy somewhere else.Was St. Anger a good album? What about Load/Reload, or their new shit? If it's "just music evolving", then why is it considered to be so fucking awful?	dubstep	1326747594
Except Rusko is still throwing shows, Skream and Benga are still doing their own thing. Distance is seriously doing work and so are many of the other artists.They are all still around, but it's not "obvious" rave music. You can't expect the average high school kid to listen to [hunted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jd6FIQjck8) and like it, but give them an obvious hook and catchy beat and they won't care what it's called. 	dubstep	1326758681
I think a more apt comparison would be new (nu) metal like As I Lay Dying, Artreyu, and all the metalcore crap. That is what is considered metal nowadays. I have many friends in the metal scene and I really don't like the type of music that is happening. It's all about "brootal screaming" and "brootal breakdowns" in just about every single song.Same goes for popular dubstep that is all about "Dat drop". I guess I'm saying is that not all new directions in music can be credited as "evolution". More often than not, it just splinters into a new direction rather than becoming something else. Too many people in this subreddit think skrillex and zeds dead are a "natural progression" whereas really it's just something completely different: electro with a 2 step beat. 	dubstep	1326761670
Your comment is that the originators got "stale". I'm saying they didn't at ALL. The originators of the genre don't care about what's in the mainstream. Burial, Kode9, all of those artists are still pushing boundaries and aren't doing it to get to the top of charts. &gt;You don't have to like the direction of the genre into the mainstream, but don't call it something different. If it's around 140 bpm and has a 2-step beat and sub-bass, it's dubstep, no matter how heavy it is.See that's the thing. It IS completely different. There is absolutely no remnants of dubstep in some of this newer stuff. There is no hi hat groove, use of space, or deep driving subbass.I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BAD BECAUSE OF THAT. It's just a different genre now.I don't think Skrillex is revolutionary. Dubstep has always had heavy shit. Have you heard of [Vex'D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqV6zeCFkJQ) or [Distance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_XG0ntxxKM)? Now compare that with [UKF](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA-isicHaZE&amp;feature=player_profilepage) or [Mord Fustang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVxPmuQqjBY). Yeah, there are some basic drum elements there, but it's totally different than what the genre started out as.Also, I don't need to "win" anything. I already made up my mind. I like listening to both types of -step music. I like dropping Skrillex and Downlink and Porter Robinson in my sets. I will say I despise hearing it constantly played on the radio, but I don't have any inherent problems with it. To be frank, this is a matter of subjectivity and definition. I have a definition of dubstep. You have a definition of dubstep. Our definitions do not align and most likely never will. 	dubstep	1326763898

Hm guess I don't have it up there anymore, but this essentially breaks a precedent of allowing "loosely related" videos.

If popularity was to be a judge, this subreddit would be overflowing with memes and rage comics already. It isn't because we essentially blacklisted quickmeme and all of those hosts so they go into the spam filter. Same with facebook events (although in that case it's obviously just spampromotion). I'm not calling you out in particular, but we discussed that we'd rather remove posts such as this as a precedent to allowing all sorts of videos in. I'm not saying it's not hilarious or that I hate skrillex or whatever, it's just that really... redditors have an amazingly difficult time trying to contribute original content, and that is what we are desperately trying to promote. 	dubstep	1327462517

To be fair, people using Massive presets generally have it show up obvious in their production. You can easily tell a preset once you've heard them all... and it really does detract from the value of the work (at least for me).It's so much more rewarding to learn how the program works or reverse-engineer the presets to bend to your will, as well as make it sound better/more original .	edmproduction	1327647823
That really doesn't apply to music production. A pair of great monitors will go a LONG way towards making your mixes sound better. Legitimate programs, VSTs, synthesizers, MIDI pads/keyboards can only help.Yes, you don't necessarily NEED it. But saying that you don't need good equipment to produce is very untrue.

Because they just do.Why not? Maybe they just don't like the music he makes, or his general fanbase, or how he rose to popularity.Some of his tunes are cool, some aren't. He's really popular due to the fact that people keep talking about him, good or bad non-discriminating.For the most part, he makes electro influenced dubstep, which is far from the roots of the genre. Some people don't like that. Some do, and those people should probably be looking for electro rather than dubstep.  	dubstep	1327836008

It's not fucking arbitrary. You're calling a Honda Civic an SUV and then wondering why people are annoyed because of "it's all just cars man"	electronicmusic	1329081301
what, the difference between electro and dubstep and drum and bass?There's a VERY clear distinction between those things, moombahcore, and all of these other genres. Claiming that it's "splitting hairs" is hardly accurate.Sure you don't have to go as far as post-garage 2-step, but there's a clear difference between the main ones. 	electronicmusic	1329159748

The genres are already broken down by tempo. dnb is 170-178, house is ~128, midtempo is ~100, dubstep is 140, etc.Stylistically is breaks down even more. Neurofunk, Liquid, Jump-up, Darkstep are all subgenres of Drum n Bass and are EXTREMELY different.Sure some artists like to combine styles, but it still HAS to fit in somewhere in order for categorization to make sense.Regardless of what the 'im making new genres' people are trying to say, 	electronicmusic	1329195306

it's not a sense of humor, its a matter of principle. If we allowed images in, this place would be flooded with stupid memes and people trying to be funny.it's not about that. It's about the music. Whether the right music is getting in is a whole other discussion, but I'd rather have it be that than 60% memes Popularity does not distinguish anything. People upvote stupid shit all the time because it's easy and takes no effort. 	dubstep	1329289644
I understand your perspective, but the upvote/downvote system is flawed in that sensational, and "Easy" content such as picture is much more likely to get upvoted as opposed to a song or a video that requires any sort of time investment.If pictures were allowed "once in a while" we'd be accused of favoritism and censoring certain images, so it's usually best to avoid them altogether unless it's something like a list of dubstep artists, etc. Look at r/gaming for example. It's quickly becoming a mess of rage comics and sensationalist articles about companies. I'd rather not letting that happen here.I'm not calling you out specifically, it's just that I feel it's a policy that should be enforced, sorry man. 	dubstep	1329292669
love Celldweller, and he's certainly an awesome producer. Good stuff :D 	dubstep	1329342423
You need a.) a subwoofer, b.) attention span, and usually a DJ mix because the point of most of his tunes is to be mixed.It's hardly "Boring". that's like calling acoustic guitar a "boring" instrument as opposed to heavy metal. Quite a lot of people think the same thing about all the electro influenced stuff that just tries to blow your ears out rather than convey any sort of atmosphere 	dubstep	1329342611
This is all sorts of fucked up.Most people in this subreddit really don't have strong feelings one way or another. Most of us like some "brostep" and some "real dubstep", some days one more than the other.It's stupid that someone decided to make r/realdubstep because of a lack of dubstep posts, and now more people want to move because of the criticism.Can't everyone just... get past it? Yes there will always be critics and "haters". Just don't deal with them. It's really not that hard. Some people aren't going to like the same things you like, and they are going to be vocal about it.That's fine, as long as they are reasonable. "Skrillex sucks lololol fuk u brostep" is not acceptable. "I dislike this song because of A, B, and X" is fine. This isn't r/trees, and it will never be. Don't expect everyone to be friendly all the time. **Moral of the story**: be the change you want to see in the world. Post more dubstep, whatever that term means to you. Post a lot of it. Be nice to people. If they are wrong about something, politely correct them. If someone's posting electro, point them in the right direction without being a dick. If you think a particular sound is unpleasing, voice your criticisms while being constructive. 	dubstep	1329360517

the attitude from both sides is annoying. Yeah there are a lot of tards who think Skrillex is the ultimate dubstep artist and still think that "theme song dubstep remix" is a viable way to discover music, but if there were more people actually contributing content, we wouldn't have this problem.	dubstep	1329361871

&gt; And when I tell people I listen to dubstep, I don't need to explain, "well, uh, it's kind of like, electro, but like, with really low bass and uh, this kinda funky beat to it." Instead people will go, "oh, yeah I listen to Skrillex!" and I can smile and nod and not be pretentious 'cause without the guy they wouldn't even know what dubstep is.for me, a "im not really into skrillex, i like other kinds of dubstep" has worked out fine too. 	dubstep	1329510203

Good idea in theory... but everyone and their mom is a dubstep producer nowadays, so I don't think it would have the desired effect that you are looking for.And once we start discriminating based on who is actually a legitimate producer, the favoritism arguments begin. 	dubstep	1330412334
100 upvotes, all negative comments... no idea how that works.Anyway, might be an ok tune if J Davis would shut up already, EDM doesn't need vocals 	dubstep	1330579294
&gt; I didnt claim he was a "visionary", im saying nobody was. Question: when you first heard skrillex, did you have any fucking idea he was going to see anywhere near this level of success or attention, let alone win three fucking Grammies?Yes. Because a release and endorsement by deadmau5 lead directly to that. Nobody predicted him winning any grammys but also nobody would shut the fuck up about him. His free EP showed up absolutely EVERYWHERE. With that kind of distribution it didn't matter what kind of music he made, he was going up. 	dubstep	1330721823
I never claimed to not have respect for him. I think he has some awesome tracks, and his production is fantastic. I'm just saying he had a lot of connections that helped and people who knew what to look for. You can do anything with a large network. 	dubstep	1330761825
\m/ 	dubstep	1330770102
It's not exclusive. It can be all of those things. Record Companies are responsible for capitalizing on trends, and have been for a long while now. My point is that he was in the right place at the right time, which meant more than being musically talented. Basically, just because he is very well known does not imply that he is automatically exempt from criticism. I just hate all of the people crying "oh youre just a hipster and hate him because he's popular". 	dubstep	1330846512
Record companies aren't just about distributing the hard product. It's about connections between artists and producers and distributors. Having that network is immensely important. They're still important because they EXIST. You can't possibly say record companies are becoming irrelevant if you pay any attention to EDM. Play Me RECORDS, Rottun RECORDS, Mau5trap RECORDS. All record labels and all fulfill their own purpose.Besides that, they aren't idiots themselves. Skrillex created OWSLA to push sounds similar to his own because they were doing very well. Many artists changed their game to have releases on there (Spor/Feed Me, Ewun/Kill The Noise). It doesn't mean that they are necessarily only out for profits, but we do NOT live in a meritocracy. It's naive to think that he became who he is today only because of talent and hard work. Networking is most of an artists success, and he had the groundwork laid out. Popularity promotes popularity. 	dubstep	1330848149
&gt; At least 80% of the music I listen to these days is by artists that got their start on the internet.and how did you get to it? You misunderstand me. I'm not saying there are "corporations" controlling the music and media distribution for financial gain. I'm saying is that it is a process that happens naturally. People like to jump onto opportunities to gain success. Many people started making dubstep when it started gaining momentum in order to ride the wave. My point is that connections are everything. If you can send your music out to 300 million people at once, it is bound to catch on regardless of quality.	dubstep	1330854665
1. Good luck. So can everyone else. Yet how many of them do you hear about? Just because the internet allows people to distribute their music to everyone does not mean they will be successful. Either they have to have some connections to get it into dedicated outlets, or be insanely, insanely lucky to be noticed. 2. Yet they did. Starting from his free Ep that his every relevant music blog to the people who talk shit nonstop, you can't mention dubstep without hearing skrillex come up somewhere in that conversation. 3. What about Rebecca Black, Justin Bieber, and any band you hear on the radio now? The wider the audience, the more potential they have.I don't see how you can possible argue that connections aren't everything in the media world. The more powerful your network, the more powerful your impact will be if you were to be exposed. Deadmau5 can link any random kid on his facebook and he will gain exposure. Hell, Conan O'Brien made a random fan a star just by linking her twitter account. God forbid someone with too many facebook likes were to link one of my songs, I would enjoy some measure of success simply based on that exposure alone, no matter what the quality of my production is. 	dubstep	1330860827
I haven't dismissed anyone from getting their start on the internet. All I said is that it isn't that likely to happen without either a lot of luck or connections!&gt; Oh, I see. So every blogger was in on the conspiracy? You seriously don't think any of those blogs posted his stuff because, I don't know, they actually liked it? What fucking conspiracy? You know most blogs are on mailing lists and hear about upcoming artists from record labels. If someone knows a lot of them, he can get a lot of exposure by sending promos to all of these places, and the more the better.&gt; I hate to break this to you, but maybe the main reason your music isn't getting the exposure you want is because it just isn't as good as his.Starting, don't start attaching adjectives like "good" because that's a whole other discussion. Secondly, I said if there was EXPOSURE such as what he had. It's not a conspiracy, damnit. It's about being in the right place at the right time and knowing the right people. Just because the internet is an available resource does not mean that Joe Nobody can suddenly make a musical career out of being "talented" simply by putting his songs on youtube. Yes, it does happen sometimes, but not very often due to the fact that EVERYBODY can do it, and you need certain connections to rise above the pack .	dubstep	1330895981
what do you think is going to happen?Oh, skream said I should be more open minded about music.. I guess I will be!Everybody always thinks they're right, from the haters to the blind worshippers. It just annoys the fuck out of everyone else at this point.Why can't I open r/dubstep and not see anything about skrillex 	dubstep	1330896434
&gt; All production related topics should be addressed to /r/edmproduction	dubstep	1330896473
&gt; This isn't just about music, by the way. Yes, a lot of luck is involved, and succeeding in music especially can be a crapshoot. But the harder you work, the more luck you seem to have. And If youre as good as you think you are, eventually connections will come to you.That's a fair point. In fact, its way more optimistic than my current view. My fear is that much of musical success is a closed circle that just perpetuates itself without much outside influence entering in. It's not always true, there are plenty of awesome artists who got to where they are simply by being awesome, but it's difficult to tell where people are coming from, and I feel the intent of a person means a lot here.So, I think we're both right to an extent. Not everything is necessarily rigged, but sometimes pulling strings does help a lot. 	dubstep	1330934253

...no that's pretty much the most direct way to do it, other than just deleting those posts.We're not letting the popular mindset take over here. Why? Because the majority of people don't know what BPM stands for, don't know what a subwoofer does, don't know what an "electro" is, and still think "stupid hipsters just hate skrillex because he's popular". That's why it's clearly established in the sidebar to not post about certain topics, because they do not contribute to any discussion.

I'm going with yes. Amazing mix, lots of different vibes on it as well. Sure it gets more than a little wobbly at parts, but there is PLENTY of subbass to make up for it.

This has nothing to do with anything at all. It drops at :55 because that is about roughly 32 bars of music at 140bpm. Pretty much every single dubstep tune drops the bass/beat at either :24 (16bars) or :55 (32). Occasionally more at 1:32 or so on depending on song structure.It has nothing to do with the type of music made, it's just song structure. 	dubstep	1332397085
This video isn't going to change anything.The issue is that people are labeling many different things as "dubstep".Some people don't like what others are defining as dubstep, so they get mad and start hating on it. It'd be like if someone said they love comic books because they've seen every Spiderman movie. 	dubstep	1332397545
This is exactly true. If we let it have its own course, this subreddit would just be circlejerks about how "haters" suck and how about "real" dubstep isn't popular enough. We get it, just keep posting tunes and what ends up winning will just have to be the standard, you can't do much else. 	dubstep	1332590596

It's not really about karma at all, I just assume most people would understand that better as a reason rather than "memes are promoting anti-intellectualism by lowering the amount of attention required to properly absorb content"In a subreddit where a lot of people skip to :55 in a song instead of listening to the thing through, and then mostly comment just to talk about how they hate another group of listeners, I'd rather enact whatever power I have to prevent this from becoming another r/gaming or r/atheism. 	dubstep	1332747843
I would love for more people to make posts like this rather than flaming.It is ok to be unaware of the genre distinctions and be willing to learn more, and offering that knowledge is the best thing you can possibly do to better the genre and the community.

Well for one, a Dubstep DJ wouldn't be performing an improvised live show, that would make them something completely different.Also, I don't see any DnB in this. What's wrong with it being considered dubstep? i hear the same influences that many dubstep tunes have. Low basslines, 2-step swing, a lot of reggae/dub type sounds as well.I'm confused how calling this style dubstep is somehow offensive. Dubstep isn't electro.

It doesn't, people just label everything with a 2-step beat as dubstep nowadays. It's a great tune, she plays it well, but most people consider [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acYn_fy563Q) as dubstep. . 	AdviceAnimals	1333018325
Eh, the problem is that soon absolutely everything will  have "HOT NEW BANGIN RELEASE" next to it.I'd say stick to the [YEAR] or label cat. number and things will be good.Only way to make this catch on is to start doing it so... get to it 	dubstep	1333136414
yup thats me!I say just start doing it. Mess around with a few DAWs like Ableton/Reason, etc to see what works for you, then it's simply a matter of putting the time into learning how everything works. Everything else comes from experience and learning from tutorials and whatnot. Like most things, producing takes time and persistence. 	DnB	1333136612
yeah, still need to implement the "TRACK AND ARTIST ONLY GODDAMNIT" header. I haven't figured out how to CSS it yet, but hopefully will get around to it. I'm just saying "go do it" so it might set some kind of precedent for everyone else to follow. 	dubstep	1333137711

the people who made the chart have had quite an influence on actually creating the sound as well, and probably know many of the members personally. 	dubstep	1335930558
Sure it could use updating to include where dubstep is TODAY, but it's a pretty good representation of the origins of the genre which is what I think it was meant to do 	dubstep	1335936791
thank you for listening, im glad you enjoyed it!You should check out rinse.fm J:Kenzo, Distance, SP:MC... all those guys throw down some amazing sets there	realdubstep	1335948767
yes they have. It's like saying "jazz and blues aren't part of my culture/heritage because they haven't had any effect on the music i listen to", when in fact those artists have had EVERYTHING to do with bringing music to the stage that it is at today. You don't dismiss a link in the chain just because you don't like it. 	dubstep	1335993764
yeah it's up on the [actual mixcloud page](http://www.mixcloud.com/resykle/subwoofer-submarine-deep-dubstep-mix/)	realdubstep	1335994079
I still don't understand how the hell it is "elitist" in any way. It's a chart, it doesn't have an opinion. If I had the opportunity to make an updated chart, I guess I would include Skrillex somewhere in it, why not? At the time it was made, I'm betting he didn't even know dubstep existed. All of these artists have contributed to the scene by creating the foundation of dubstep that exists today.It's like complaining a chart about the evolution of metal that includes Black Sabbath and Megadeth but excludes Brokencyde or some new screamo band. 	dubstep	1336025261
sorry bro, but there's nothing dubstep about this/r/electrohouse 	dubstep	1336165774

Yes in 2 weeks 	dubstep	1336260284
That's true but it leads to things that are not dubstep. I can't listen to that song atm, and im sure it's great but changing the bpm changes the fundamental structure. There's a reason drumstep distances itself from dnb and dubstep 	dubstep	1336260379
there is a perk in cod which does pretty much exactly that.It all depends on playstyle, you can play BF3 like a lone wolf as well. You can play CoD and contribute to the team by running support, calling in UAVs, Recon Drones, etc. A well coordinated team in CoD can annihilate everything 	gaming	1336266436

&gt; I couldn't care what genre a song is, if I enjoy the song I enjoy it. Why should I change my opinion because of its genre?You don't have to stop liking it! Just read up on it a bit. What's wrong with knowing more about what you are listening to?There's nobody telling you can't like a song because it's not the genre you thought it was. That's just fucking stupid.

also definitely a valid point. I know i'd hate to sit through 14 tracks of exactly the same wobwobwobwobwob. I guess I just want to make sure people are submitting dubstep rather than claiming to be innovative when really they're just making something else entirely 	dubstep	1336340525

You're missing the point. It's not about being better or worse, it's knowledge that enriches your experience and helps you find out about more.It's incredibly ignorant and stupid to cast down people who are trying to classify and explain the genre as though they have some sort of "agenda" behind it all 	dubstep	1336444922
&gt; If you had it your way I would have NEVER heard most of the artists I now enjowtf why not, i'm not going to delete everything that's not burial or mala from here. why would that even make sense?i'm not talking about forcing everyone to take a dubstep exam, i'm saying that r/dubstep is not r/electronicmusic, so there has to be dubstep here. You don't have to be offended if someone says that what you're listening to isn't dubstep... there is tons of different dubstep being posted here, i dont see how you could complain about that 	dubstep	1336460442
its arbitrary, bro Your favorite artist is someone else's least favorite. Neither of you are right, neither of you are wrong.	dubstep	1336510902
how on earth is it ridiculous?have you heard of house music or drum n bass? Its ok if you aren't to familiar with EDM, but the genres ARE the tempos.YOU CANNOT HAVE A HOUSE TRACK AT 160bpm. It's just something completely different then!Why is it hard to believe that Dubstep has certain restrictions, and more so... why is this a bad thing?!	Music	1336526745
Those statements about rock don't apply to EDM.It's the beat structure of the song that classifies it as House, DnB, drumstep, etc. From then on it gets more specific depending on the actual content of the music, i.e. electro, neurofunk, fidget, etc. Right now "Dubstep" means so many different things its almost pathetic. Mostly because people keep saying "oh music doesn't need labels", when in reality, what the hell is wrong with labels?Have you ever tried recommending to someone and all they said was "i dunno i just like the heavy stuff". That's not helpful at all!	Music	1336526916
really need to be more specific here.what type of music do you like now, and what other electronic artists do you like 	dubstep	1336527074
some good tunes on there, although not really what I liked IM for.at least J Davis isn't anywhere near this!	dubstep	1336527271
Yeah but putting all those sounds together is a completely different challenge.Compare making a synth patch to finding a tree, cutting it down, cutting it up, handcrafting a guitar from scratch, then stringing it, tuning it, building your own amp and guitar cables, and THEN finally learning how to play it.Not to mention recording, mixing, and mastering the whole thing yourself... as well as then creating the drums, bass, and all other parts of the track. 	dubstep	1336527513

shit, i've been producing pretty much every day for the past 3 years and I know i'm only on the tip of the iceberg. It's terrible when people who haven't got a clue what goes into the process talk trash.Producing, arranging, and mixing a track is like finding a tree, chopping it down, hacking it up, carving a fine guitar out of it, making your own strings, learning how to tune it, then sanding and painting it too. And now you only have 1 instrument down... 	dubstep	1338007297
Ah see but you need to know how to produce before you can do anything with it.If you know how to play guitar, you can play any genre of music you want. Some of it may come more naturally, but in theory you could really recreate any song.Same with producing, if you know how to make synths and mix, all you really need to do is change the tempo 	dubstep	1338009217
You do need 500 hours to tell you what knob to turn and how much to turn it. I'm not denying that playing a physical instrument is difficult, but making a track like Noisia takes a lot more than "turning knobs" 	dubstep	1338046839
Why wouldn't you have to practice? You may not be restrained  by the physical, but you have to know a LOT about synthesis and mixing to get anything out, nOt to mention knowing how to actually write a song  	dubstep	1338060219
~~Skrillex did it!!~~ (sorry couldn't resist)But those things DO give you ability and creativity. Even speaking of skrillex... i think he admitted he doesn't know much music theory, but it's those SOUNDS that made it.You can make an entire song using only 1 note and it will sound awesome	dubstep	1338071294
I hope you're not referring to me. I just admitted that I would never ever consider myself an expert in producing. I just want to emphasize the fact that producing is a lot harder than just "pushing buttons" and "making wobs". People who have never tried to produce usually say this because they just see you staring at a computer screen rather than making physical movements. 	dubstep	1338071467
good point, i retract my misguided attempt at justifying myself :P 	dubstep	1338073352
thats pretty much what i just said. My point is that you don't NEED to know how to write a progression if you can make amazing sounds to go along with it. So much of electronic music is sampled anyway that it really is about where you take things to rather than where you get them from 	dubstep	1338078811

&gt; The problem is when you pretend to do something you aren’t really doing. People crave authenticity, and in EDM today, they are beginning to demand it.He's spot on here. You can argue about the benefits and downfalls of the digital age all you want, but what it all comes down to is the intent with which you are performing.If you're using the sync button because you are too lazy and inept to learn how to mix, and don't even try to go beyond mixing intro/outro, hitting sync, and dancing around, then you are not a DJ.If you're using those extra few seconds to blend in extra tracks and create a performance, then you are utilizing the equipment to it's full capacity rather than using it as a crutch.I believe that it should always be challenging, because if you are being challenged then you will gradually improve and it will shine through your work, rather than complacently tapping away at 'sync'. 	dubstep	1340851148

That's a VERY unnecessary title and I want to make a statement that we won't allow this sort of thing in the future.Just post the artist and song title. If it's good people will listen to it and if he happens to reach 1 mil views then good for him. This isn't some sort of promotional platform. And don't post age. Nobody cares about that.  	dubstep	1342421890
I meant in the sense that you shouldn't make posts with some sort of incentive behind them other than to share music. "LIKE THIS FACEBOOK PAGE" or "HELP ME REACH ____ VIEWS" aren't even remotely subtle attempts at trying to attract attention. It makes it seem like the artist only cares about the numbers rather than the quality of the work.That's my personal stance. I know I've posted my own tunes here, but I do my best to keep it impartial at the least. 	dubstep	1342422222

I'm not going to argue that. I know tek fairly well and I trust him enough to say that if he played it, it's real. He doesn't have to know them personally. Maybe he's on an exclusive list, maybe they are starting to hand it out to more people to play out, maybe he just got lucky and knows a guy who knows a guy. There are any number of possibilities here beyond "he ripped it from a mix".	dubstep	1342756523

You're making it seem that by not fighting against 'injustice' you are directly supporting it. If you choose to go that route you would have to shut down nearly all of your connections. If you can't be a scout because of the organizations traditional views, why would you buy shoes made in an exploited country? Why would you use non-recyclable materials? Just as you can take certain moral lessons from the bible without following all of it word for word, i'm sure you can become an Eagle scout for the sake of learning all their positive qualities, as opposed to some traditionally conservative worldview. 	pics	1342827862
So stop buying from companies that oursource to exploited countries, from companies that exploit illegal immigrants, from those who lobby senators, etc etc. You'll be left with an extremely small list and even those probably have SOME sort of connections to 'injustice'. I'm saying is that everyone draws a line somewhere and picks certain battles to fight. This just might not be one of them. 	pics	1342860195
definitely worth it. I have to say i have a new outlook on the whole 'sync button' thing, because it definitely becomes a clusterfuck when you try to keep track of 4 tempos drifting away from each other.I don't really play out anywhere, but once I get used to the s4 i'll just take that with me, the turntables are kind of redundant since the s4 can control 4 decks anyway. But they are nice to have!	DJSetups	1342994943

I think you are making a mistake by comparing live electronic performance to that of an instrument, at least as far as physical attributes go. Yes, it's pretty simple to figure out what buttons are triggering what and in what order, but it's not about the technical skill involved. Anyone can really learn how to match 2 songs tempos to the same bpm,  just as anyone can learn how to finger a chord on a guitar, but that still will not help you become a better musician or DJ. For a setup like Deadmau5 has, you'd have to create all of those sounds, think of how to use them, map them all and still try and find room for improvisation and creativity.I personally have been mixing for 3 years and I would never call myself 'proficient'. If i put in the same time that you put in playing the viola, I'd probably learn so much more that my skill would improve vastly and allow me to do more creative things live to bring a new level of performance. I guess my point is that calling a live performance or a DJ mix as 'button pushing' is like calling your viola playing 'string pressing'to you they might not have that intimacy, but i'm vouching for the amount of soul and potential  in my turntables. 	edmproduction	1343163754
Just saying, ZD generally produced higher energy music than what a lot of people in this sub are into, so you are going to get many biased opinions.I think their production is good, but they don't make the sound that I'm into so I usually steer clear of them. 	realdubstep	1343185996

that's not true, stuff like skrillex/borgore tops the page plenty of times. A lot of people repost the same song though and it gets annoying. This subreddit gets a hardon for one particular artist every once in a while and beats them to death. It was skrillex at some point, then Feed Me, Kill The Noise, and now Tristam. Maybe some people just want to see more variety. There are plenty of haters on both sides, and unfortunately there is nothing that can be done about this. Keep your hands inside the ride at all times and hope that everyone will follow suit. Some people are assholes, and that's their problem. 	dubstep	1343372165

Just because it's different doesn't mean it's necessarily bad.Do you want another rehash of Halo 2? People pick up games for new experiences, not the same one with different maps.Halo has always been about taking the best things about other FPS and combining them into a great package, and I"m sure this one will still be fun 	halo	1345016026
It's very different from what Halo used to be, and different is often seen as 'bad' and 'scary'.CoD has a similar setup, but it does actually even out. Just because someone has certain perks does not mean they are invincible, it just means you have to approach the scenario differently. Keep in mind NONE OF US HAVE EVEN PLAYED THE DAMN GAME YET! It's way too early to call out "unbalanced", and if 343 has any sense they would patch the offending perks as quickly as the issues are brought up.I do wish it was closer to the whole "run, grab a gun, start shooting" mechanic, but change does not always have to be a bad thing.Besides, what with the XBL cloud storing your gamertag, you can have your perks wherever you go. 	halo	1345016612

seriously calm down. He's not saying all kids with ADD are lazy, but you must be naive if you don't think lazy kids get diagnosed with ADD just to get on amphetamines.I know tons of people who have gone to doctors with the INTENT of getting a prescription. I'm sure there are plenty of 'depressed' people out there who just need a kick in the ass to change their situation.	AdviceAnimals	1345455045
The problem is that it becomes abusive. You're not going to the doctor because you need help, you go because it is a stimulant and a drug. The difference is between simply dealing with things you don't want to do and popping a pill that makes you interested in ANYTHING.You could argue the 'better living through chemistry' bit, but if that's the case why don't we just dump amphetamines in the water supply? That's a different discussion however...	AdviceAnimals	1345457945
Fair point. But if we say that these types of drugs make you 'better' at being productive and so on, especially to the point where there are so many people on them already, then why not introduce them to the rest of  the population?I understand it's quite of a stretch, but Adderall (for example) is so widespread among college campuses it might as well be a vitamin supplement. It's clear that there is a demand for such drugs that make it easier to concentrate on anything you want to start doing, no matter how mundane (I took some adderall and painted half my house, had a blast the entire time and didn't stop once). I think the counter-argument is that we should be looking for motivation to resolve our problems within ourselves rather than making statements like "I don't have the capacity to pay attention" "my brain chemistry is what makes me unhappy" as opposed to "I need to work harder and change my situation".I know there are people that DO have serious issues who NEED these drugs to function... but they are by far not the only ones who want prescriptions. 	AdviceAnimals	1345494304
&gt; Different people have different needs, and saying that "hey, your life is better on Adderal, so we should give it to everyone!" is fairly ignorant.perhaps, but there are many people who believe that it does make their life better, despite not actually needing to take it. You are right that 'giving it to everyone' is a bit premature.&gt; You're talking about intensive therapy and lifestyle changes which will require teams of professionals and weeks of otherwise unproductive activity for the individual in question. It's cheaper to allow that person to spend money on drugs which solve the problem for them.Again, I don't want to include people who actually have learning disabilities.But it just seems that ADD has such a... loose criteria. I was diagnosed with it years back and the questions ranged from "do you think about random things" to "do you like paying attention to things you aren't particularly interested in". Naturally every teenager is absentminded at best, but to call that a disability seems wrong to me. Of course I'm only one person, but many of my peers just lie to doctors to get a prescription and then either sell the pills or take them during finals week. 	AdviceAnimals	1345496522
I understand the point you are making from the natural/unnatural side, but my issue is more of the mindset that comes along with making everything 'easier'. You are right, it is a natural progression for us to find ways to fine-tune our minds using chemistry to better ourselves and perhaps even cure these mental disorders (i feel like thats the right term to describe ADD/HD). I believe it is the attitude that is the problem however.If you were writing an essay and would much rather be doing anything else in the world, and someone came along and offered you a pill that would make you concentrate on that one thing (or any one thing), would you take it? I imagine most people would. But then when those people start going to doctors and telling them that they have 'trouble paying attention' just so that they can cram and get their work out of the way, it starts to become less of a medication and more of a recreational substance.That's why people like MarlonBain (the guy i originally replied to) get so upset when people don't take their condition seriously. Getting an adderal prescription is only a tiny bit harder than getting one for medicinal marijuana, and the symptoms are nearly as vague. On that note, yeah we know that marijuana has health benefits, but you cannot deny that so so many of the 'patients' are just people tired to calling up drug dealers. 	AdviceAnimals	1345530455

very true, Mala always has amazing rthyms. But personally I like the dark, overproduced, almost 'mechanical' sounds as opposed to Malas more... "tribal" riddims. I wish there was more stuff like early Datsik/excision, but i suppose we're on to different things now. 	dubstep	1346395464

minor tempo change is about 35bpm, which is pretty fast actually.If you get really technical then yeah it doesn't really make much of a difference (techstep vs darkstep, in my opinion, is splitting hairs) but there is definitely a difference between House, Drum n Bass, and Dubstep. It's like saying there's no reason to have Metal and Rock just because they all use guitars. There is a level at which there is a clear difference. 	dubstep	1347261103

for the love of god don't just focus on making it 'all filthy bruv' or changing synths every single beat. Dubstep *in my opinion* should be all about rhythm and syncopation. You need to create a sense of rhythm without overloading the listener with synths. Listen to stuff like this and see how the synths/basslines/hats carry the kick to the snare[Megalodon &amp; Conscious Pilot - Gangster Shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nsv1FP-l0M)[SP:MC &amp; LX One - Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KBycYdABY)	dubstep	1347938703

totally making this up as I go along...but I think a lot of dubstep is going the way of techno as far as being made more for DJs to mix than people to listen to.

It was never really meant to be an updatable page, just something that had the major labels at the time.

Because for a while he made everyone associate electro with dubstep, and that changed many parts of the genre in directions that many people didn't like. You couldn't even say 'dubstep' without people thinking you're talking about him, and that got annoying real quick.Now all the people that loved his sound in the first place say they hate him simply because he's popular. Seriously dont know how many people I have seen say they hate skrillex and love knife party when they make practically the same type of sound!I personally think his dubstep is kind of annoying and isn't at all what I got into the genre for.

If you had actually read OPs post you would see he is not criticizing certain dubstep artists of not being "real" dubstep. Rather, songs that aren't even remotely resemblant of dubstep are called "dubstep" by those who either don't know any better, or simply don't care.He wants to know how he could help educate those who think anything with "wobbles" is dubstep. You wouldn't go to a Honda dealership looking for Jeeps, so why should there be irrelevant content here?	dubstep	1355726265
None of that invalidates what I said. The scene IS oversaturated, it's being played in commercials, on top 40 radio, and is the new blanket term for EDM (replacing "techno"). I fail to see how trying to be more educational about what Dubstep is a bad thing. [This is my favorite dubstep, what you gonna do](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA)	dubstep	1355783001
&gt; What I do care about is if I'm listening to music and someone begins to try and educate me if I use a broad sense of description. ...ok dude I said this&gt;He wants to know how he could help educate those who think anything with "wobbles" is dubstep.In my comment above I linked Levels. Do you think Levels is dubstep? It is not dubstep. It is not dubstep in the same way that Nickelback is not Death Metal. Do you see why it's important to draw distinctions?Nobody cares about how specific you want to get in your subgenres here. In fact, there aren't really subgenres as much as there are different styles. "Brostep" is barely even a thing. Dubstep is just Dubstep. What we want to do is keep out the stuff that isn't even dubstep to begin with. It's not a matter of opinion. EDM is different than rock music in that genres aren't defined by melodic tone but rather by rhytmic structure. There is a clear difference between House music and Drum &amp; Bass. Are you going to go into r/dnb and post house music just because you feel like it? I certainly hope not.	dubstep	1355786342

Dubstep doesn't really have a "liquid" thing going on. It's more establish in DnB by artists like [Netsky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAC1ut-yTyY), [Logistics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLcszY2d2KE), and Hospital Records. As some else mentioned, it's very mellow and has instruments like pianos, strings, and vocals. on the complete polar opposite end you have stuff like [Darkstep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhDL3gs8WO8) which is really a shitton of kick drums and breaks in the evilest mood imaginable. There's also really technical stuff like [Noisia &amp; Phace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyrwMmsufJc) which is labeled as NeuroFunk, which is much more complicated production wise.All of these relate to Dubstep in that many of these same artists make Dubstep. DnB is 170-178 beats minute with snares on the 2 and the 4. Dubstep is 140 beats per minute with a snare on the 3rd beat.I guess what gets called [Liquid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBhapQM6NHM) dubstep is the same way: calmer. However I think it's unnecessary since most Dubstep started out being more minimal anyway ([Phaeleh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcm-cmmEnCY))Brostep is kind of a derogatory term for Dubstep that has a lot more midrange and emphasis on hooks and catchy leads than atmosphere, but you can really break that down into being [Electro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrFzQAU6s-U) influenced and [Drum &amp; Bass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBNCxzhceAc) Influenced.hope that helps, and i provided links which should be helpful	dubstep	1356083905
it would be half time in that case (i believe)You could count Dubstep as being 70 with a snare on the 2 and 4 beat, or as 140 with a snare on the 3 beat	dubstep	1356084143

As someone mentioned, it is more balanced. No perks, no power weapons. Just you and one bullet is all it takes. Its helped me get much better in halo by being able to nail headshots.

I'm not saying you should play it if it feels like you're cutting off your arm... But the game isn't "broken" as much as many claim it is. I've met tons of people who enjoy playing it without any qualms. Calling it "half done" and what equates to "a waste of money" doesn't seem constructive to me. "The boltshot is overpowered" is a legitimate complaint, but bashing the whole game because it's "similar to CoD" just seems unnecessary. Yeah people complained about Halo 2 because it wasn't halo 1 and complained about Halo 3 because it wasn't Halo 2 but what did you expect? Everyone bitched about Modern Warfare 3 because it was the same as MW2, so no matter what people would have complained.	halo	1356226106
Also, all valid points. I guess it's just a trend for FPS games to try and be more "fair" and "easy" for people. I mean, loadouts and ordinances give everyone an even playing field, where before if you had a competent team you could grab all the power weapons and lay waste to the other team. Hell, I remember getting a challenge unlocked in CoD for sprinting 20 miles... I understand your apprehension towards this, but I think the most important question is "Is it fun?"I want to say "Yes", it is fun. Getting a sniper rifle dropped into your lap is great, where before you'd have to sit in line behind 3 other people camping for it. The new perks do allow for a new style of gameplay, and  loadouts don't force you to feel fucked over when someone bears a more powerful weapon on you.I don't think it will ever feel like Halo CE/2/3 again, because doing so would be a huge step backwards in terms of removing all these new things people are already getting used to.Here's hoping that at least 343i brings some better maps in the future, because the whole "hold down an area" bit has vanished from 4 =\	halo	1356230918

Very nice, love the atmosphere and what sounds to be reversed sfx?The stuttered breaks are great and add a lot as well. The tune sounds great, but it just feels a little "Empty" to me. Not sure if that makes sense, but I think if you added more sweeping/automated effects to some of the instruments it would fill up space and sound great! Definitely a good job though	edmproduction	1356317292
Bass seems a little muddy at the beginning. Definitely not what I was expecting from the "hardcore" tag you have. I think your snares could use some reverb and kicks could use some kind of LFO or automation to make them seem less static... although I'm not sure if I can hear that or not already, so maybe disregard about the kicks.The synths starting at 1:47 are cool too, but could be beefed up a bit with saturation to take up more space. Overall an interesting track. The percussion is great	edmproduction	1356317434
Sub sounds fine here, your strings sound a little too synth-y for my taste though. I don't know if that's what you were going for but I would mess around with samples and effects more to have them sound more natural. A different/more natural sounding reverb always helps, but again, if that's what you were going for then it sounds fine!	edmproduction	1356317555

I think you could just skip the VST part. See if you can find some actual strings! Look through your music library and see if there are any songs that use them that you could rip them from, the higher quality the better. Then just load them in the sampler and you've got strings!If that doesn't work, I know Ableton's Sampler has some presets that has strings, and maybe some other VSTs already have a string like effect that sounds better. 	edmproduction	1356329891
I think you should concentrate on the kicks then. If that's the main focus of your song then thats what you should focus on making the most prominent. There are a lot of tricks you can do to liven them up (adding guitar amps and saturators on reverb tracks, making them change pitch via LFO, etc), and I think that could do it!	edmproduction	1356347519

I think good samples will account for 80% of how good your kick sounds. If you have a good sample to start with, then you will have significantly less work to do to make it sound good on its own.I like to steal mine from other songs. Metal bands have some awesome kick drums, so do industrial groups. After that, some saturation and EQ can take them a long way. 	edmproduction	1356393984

First off, are you seriously accusing r/realdubstep of trolling here? I've seen wayyy more comments from the other side of the fence saying "this is boring" "you are stupid hipsters" and all that type of shit in response to simple comments as "I wasn't a big fan of this". You're not going to get people to leave just because you don't like what they have to say. Like it or not, everyone has an opinion, and this is the internet so they are going to say whatever they want whether you like it or not.AFAIK there's nobody even arguing about "brostep" or whatever. If you look at the subreddit now there are a lot of "heavier/newer" types of dubstep up there anyway, including some "melodic dubstep" sitting at 100+ upvotes. There are always going to be people who disagree with you, and there is nothing you can do about it, so there is no need to create a problem out of nothing. 	dubstep	1356992422

So what you're telling me is THAT is what makes a DJ? Being able to play with CDs and vinyl? Not, you know, throwing down the perfect song that gets people moving, not mixing  in a new and creative way, not bringing new music to people, and most definitely not having fun?Yeah, you're right in a way, people SHOULD learn how to use those 2 methods. I don't disagree, i wish I had some CDJs to practice on so I could learn how to beatmatch by ear. But this is a shitty, elitist attitude to have, just because it's "Easier" now, and more accessible.

I always think its an interesting comparison to the clubs where dubstep is played in the UK where they shut the lights off to the kind of stuff they have set up for major acts. Not making a judgment either way, I think both styles of music have their place but I agree with you on it being more of a "show" than a "performance" even 	dubstep	1359840462

I wouldnt call it boring by any means.It's subtle, it's quiet. It's not trying to make you dance, or anything of the sort. This is the type of song you put on in your headphones while taking the bus or chilling at home with a nice beer and a joint. Especially when it's raining outside.I heard Burial best described as "walking back home after a party, with the sun just rising and there being a slight mist" It is truly an atmospheric piece and that's how you have to look at it.Yeah it is a big lengthy (9 minutes!), but it's not even close to the type of music most dubstep artists make	dubstep	1360901222

But do you really think "you douchebags are nothing but haters (ex: /r/REALdubstep)" is going to help the case?Just fucking downvote, hide the comment, and go on to something else. There are enough posts here that you should be able to find something, even with treeizzles occasional mass-posts. There are always going to be people who disagree with you, even more so people who are assholes about expressing their opinions. This is just a fact of life. Maybe I dont visit comments enough but that's the first 'major' flamewar i've seen here in a while, so overall I think you are overreacting.  	dubstep	1362688371

never heard of it described that way, really interesting comparison 	dubstep	1362689269
Honestly, I like to use it as a descriptive term. What would you like to call Skrillex, Zomboy, etc to separate them from other kinds of dubstep?electro-step? Brostep just kind of stuck, I think the derogatory nature of it depends on the context. 	dubstep	1362689354

It is not, Drum n Bass is a completely separate genre. Dubstep doesn't 'really' have any subgenres, just various styles and influences.You can tell by the beat structure. DnB is generally 170-175 beats per minute (bpm), Dubstep is generalyl 140 bpm half time	dubstep	1363210703

Really? More like ITT everyone on reddit has depression and if you even so much as question that then you're stupid and don't understand their pain. It's possible that some people are feeling down because of their own actions, not chemical imbalances. 	AdviceAnimals	1364295617
How about "If you're feeling depressed, at least consider making a lifestyle change before going to a psychiatrist."Could be depression is a product of the environment not mental capabilities 	AdviceAnimals	1364295773
I think it's the opposite.If someone does not exercise or eat healthy, their quality of life will diminish a bit. This may cause them to feel sad, read up about depression, and then go to the doctor with a list of symptoms that will land them a prescription. Now you are going to be altering your brain chemistry for the rest of your life.That is a life altering decision right there.

I wouldn't watch any trailers for it, they definitely try to oversell the game. If you liked the previous Fable games, you'd like it. I'd say it's the best actually in that it improves the mechanics from the previous ones, the storyline is pretty great too (definitely goes in some strange directions near the end, but in a good way).	gaming	1364782756
It's definitely one of my favorite games now, and I'd go as far as to say it deserves all the positive ratings its gotten.Only problem I really had was the "oh we need to go there! well the door is locked, time to spend an hour doing something to unlock it" and then backtracking a lot. But, that's just nitpicking, I started a 2nd playthrough about a day after I beat it for the first time	gaming	1364782974

&gt; Second to that are the "unsigned" or "undiscovered" so called musicians who write this regurgitated crap. "Hey reddit, listen to me!"; so you click, and it's just another fucking indie band, or just another wannabe DJ writing boring and overdone dance music.What I DO see, is genuine musicians and artists, with real craft and REAL music, stuff that IS different and IS good, being downvoted into fucking oblivion without a second chance Seriously? You're basically just complaining about music you like not being more popular. Removing downvotes won't fix anything, unsubscribe and find a smaller sub that fits your taste more. wtf is "REAL" music supposed to be? Music that YOU like? What about the other 2,378,149 subscribers? 	Music	1365131706
&gt; I've got a friend who's obsessed with the stuff and loves to share it, but for the life of me I can't tell the difference between one song and another. I enjoy some of it, sure, but there's a limit to the number of variations these artists are using, and it gets filled pretty quickly.the thing is, if you're not invested in the genre, you wouldn't really be able to tell the difference. It would be like someone saying "all metal sounds the same, all rap sounds the same" etc. I'm one of those "wanna -be DJs" and I'm aware that many people don't have the same appreciation for electronic music that I do. But that does not mean you can dismiss it as "not real music". The problem with this subreddit is that's trying to encompass ALL music., which is going to default to the artists that most people are aware of taking the spotlight. That's just the way of the world. I'm subscribed to a lot of the Electronic Dance Music subreddits, and although I understand your point of view regarding trance, you have to understand that there are people who truly enjoy all of it, and can discern the subtle differences between tracks. My point is basically that I think OP is just in the wrong place. There isn't a way you can force people to listen to music outside of their comfort zone, and thus they'll always promote the content that they are interested in. Between 2.3 million users, you can imagine that many similar artists are going to pop up.Tl;DR: this is not a battle you can win unless the mods decide to remove any submission that has ever been in the Billboard Top 40 (or we could extend to 100). Best thing to do is bottle your rage and find a smaller subreddit that does have the content you're looking for, instead of hoping to find it here	Music	1365141998

&gt; Are there different kinds of dupstep?of course, just as there are different genres of rock, different types of metal, different styles of hip-hop/rap. Dubstep is no different. You have the eclectic electro-influenced stuff like Nero, Skrillex, Knife Party, you have the deep and dark Distance, Vesicle, Youngsta, and then the downright insane Culprate and Melamin &amp; Wicked Sway.It's a huge genre and there is loads of it out there, you just have to find the kind you like and explore in that direction. Nero is a rather popular artist, but if you go back in their discography they actually started out closer to what Dubstep was originally established itself as, before the pressures of popularity and influences from other genres took hold.	dubstep	1365492653

you just have to make a few posts telling people about it, then reminding them, then trying to get everyone to follow directions to submit their tracks to you.The only annoying bit is getting people to finally send you their tracks. 2-3 people ALWAYS fuck up somehow and either stop responding, send you the wrong thing, or manage to find some other way to screw up the process. Then it's just a matter of converting things to FLAC and mp3, tagging the whole thing to look pretty and killing time while it uploadsI could announce it and all because of the fancy green mod title (unless you want to), but if you're down to manage the files at the end it's not too much work overall.

There are plenty of producers making Dubstep that is completely different than the electro stuff that's popular with most people. That's like saying "Chief Keef is real hip-hop because it evolved". That's not true, it's a separate genre.

Not that there is anything wrong with those things... but you need to be somewhat dedicated to the thing you (or your parents) are pouring thousands of dollars into.	AskReddit	1368487263

It might have been the song that made dubstep popular but I wouldn't say it's a classic. But then, you'd have to define what 'classic' means in the first place. I think most people who have been listening to dubstep before that one came out will have different responses than those who listen to the more electro-influenced stuff.

I want to say that people like Rusko, Distance, Coki (because of Spongebob), Vex'd, and Excision because they started taking dubstep into a completely new direction and away from the 2-step/garage roots. Rusko/Caspa has FabricLive37 which had a lot of emphasis on the "wobbles" that we know and hate today, while Distance and Excision started bringing a much heavier vibe to the genre by incorporating all those guitar amps.I know it's not one producer... but I think these people had an integral part in laying the foundations of the gritty midrange sound that people love/hate today.

I don't know if you're directing that at this tune (because cmon..), but I think the reason for that is because there are so many different things people like about Dubstep as a whole that its hard to really encompass with a select sound.I mean there's the super complextro-electro stuff, theres the deep dungeon, the jazzy/reggae vibes, the hybrid trance/step crap, and pretty much straight up industrial as well.Although honestly I rarely ever get music from here.

while I see your point, it does not impact the music. Beck is a scientologist, Lars Ulrich is a greedy nutcase, Dave Mustaine is insane. The artist's personal views do not affect one's enjoyment of the music, only your perception of the artist.If I like a song, and I learn the artist is an utter dick, that doesn't stop me from enjoying the music, although I do think less of them as a person.Similarly here, the fact that this guy is 14 years old does not make the music any better. I personally do not really like this song, but I would have thought the same regardless of how old he is. Is it great that he can produce this well (although that's subject to debate depending on how he actually made this), sure. But this subreddit isn't about giving people attention based on their lifestyles. I'd like it to be based around judging the music itself rather than anything surrounding it. Forget your friends, whats hot right now, the top 40 hits, whatever, just listen to the song and see if it finds a place in your world. 	dubstep	1375351785

You don't have to necessarily shell out $800 for Ableton, you could just pirate it and then buy it later when you have that kind of money.

Well what did you use to produce it? Did you make your own synths/patches?

If it costs $50+ for a baseball game ticket, the ticket price would take greater difficulty to acquire. (utter estimation, I see one game going for $50 but most are hovering around $20, but this is very area specific so may not apply)Also if you can't afford to buy gas, why the hell would you be traveling around going to basebal games?	pics	1375748526

I -think- the point was that a story is usually written about the team/sport that has little to do with reality. You can look at all the stats you want and read predictions of what will happen but that will have no bearing on the game itself.

theres nothing wrong with you calling it 'dubstep', and as you said, theres definitely an issue with Burial and Skrillex being under the same umbrella. But when you say there isn't enough of that type of sound (Nero, etc) on this subreddit, its a bit ridiculous as that is what has dominated for the past 2 years or so since the genre blew up. Now it's on the radio, top 40, top youtube channels, car commercials, everywhere. So the fact that this 'older' sort of sound is seeing a resurgence here, a small internet community in comparison, is a pretty cool thing.	dubstep	1376465209

yeah thats what im thinking. Skrillex has got some crazy sound design, but I think it just goes wayy too far, while Mala has that old school swing to him. Combined, all those modulated basslines could be made a lot more subtle, yet with a prominent rhythm section	dubstep	1377075794

its not because its mainstream, its because its a completely different sound..thats like saying "classic rock? so pretentious, its all just rock!" no there's a clear difference between One Direction and Queen.	dubstep	1377134422
this is true. especially with tracks like these, where it takes time to fully appreciate the subtlety. its much easier to skip to :55 and listen to -the epic drop- I am guilty of this as Im sure many are. I tend to skip around the seek bar to see if I like what im hearing, but ultimately end up voting based on the label/artist/submitter	dubstep	1377158658
ironically, bass cannon doesnt really contain that much bass	dubstep	1377284355

my only complaint would be that it seems like the basslines/lead are fighting for space w/ the drums. The drums just don't seem that 'alive' if you know what I mean. The snare doesn't really have a lot of reverb and the slower hi hat seems static. Pretty cool track otherwise, and even then Im just nitpicking cuz you asked. 	dubstep	1377510061
damn, didn't realize that was you! Sick channel for sure!	dubstep	1377510147
The right amount of reverb is the difference between something sounding flat and professional (IMO). Some eq and reverb will definitely take the snare places. I'd also make a bus for all the other instruments and eq them against the drums. Take out the freqs that are most impacted by the snare and kick and that should give it more space 	dubstep	1377572904

His music does an amazing job of conveying an emotion and atmosphere rather than any sort of obvious 'meaning'. It's really minimal and abstract, but the way he puts sounds together is sublime.It's not the music you play at a party, or during a warm summer day. I've heard it described as "walking home from a club at 6am with the sun rising in south london". His songs encompass that feeling you get when a good party ends and youre all alone after everyones left, or walking home late at night with the streets completely silent.Hopefully that doesn't sound -too- poetic, but thats what I get out of his music. There's a time/place for it and it brings a certain atmosphere 	dubstep	1378402684
it's not boring, its just subtle. you can't call a folk song boring for just having 1 guitar part. Most minimal music is meant to be played obnoxiously loud, and at that level you can pick up a lot of very subtle factors that contribute to the rhythm. It's like trance relies on those melodic leads and pulsing basslines, minimal dubstep has a really really heavy subbass line that you NEED to have big subwoofers to even fully understand	dubstep	1378420428

There's a difference between a movie following the rules of its own universe and just taking shortcuts.We know the Matrix can't really happen because machines don't feel emotions or any sorts of feelings of ill-will towards us (plus discriminating against robots seems stupid), but that doesn't mean the movie has a plot hole. People here seem to be complaining about Batman not having a realistic stock exchange but that doesn't matter at all! It's a city where a billionaire dresses up like a bat and beats up criminals for crying out loud. The hole would be him clearing several thousand miles in what appeared to be an hour after he gets out of that prison 	AskReddit	1383001105
It doesn't matter. He survived that not because he only broke a vertebrae but because he's the goddamn Batman. My point is that you shouldn't apply real life principles to movies. They're not supposed to apply. Icebergs can sink, spaceships explode with sound, and getting shot isn't a big deal. It's the writing and character actions that create plot holes because they take shortcuts through the story to reach a conclusion rather than drawing a reasonable explanation	AskReddit	1383006276

I don't think that's a problem with Halo. It's the standard for ALL FPS games now. Did you really just expect Halo 3 + new maps/story/guns? (which people would have bitched a fit about anyway) It had to be different, and this is where we are now.It's not that bad of a game, it's just different than what most expected. Oh great, and here comes the "How dare you like Halo 4" downvote brigade.	halo	1383673535
I don't see how you can compare it if you haven't played it then. I've been on Live since Halo 2, and people always complained with each Halo game that whatever new thing they added has "ruined halo" and "taken it too far from its roots". I remember reading forums bitching a storm about the armor abilities thing until everyone just got used to it. When Halo 5 drops, everyone will be complaining about something new thats ruining the franchise. And those not on this board won't give a shit and will have a great time playing it. 	halo	1383677414
Christ you have shitty reading comprehension. I never said all Halos were the same. In fact you could have taken 10 seconds to actually think about it before rotating that stick up your ass. My point is that SOMETHING WAS GOING TO CHANGE. It didn't matter what it was, some percentage of the hundreds of thousands of Halo players were going to hate it. If it didn't, **if** Halo 4 was exactly the same as 3 with just new maps and enemies then people would STILL have complained. Just enjoy the damn thing for what it is. I hate to break it to you but people have different opinion about whats fun. I LIKED THAT THEY ADDED SPRINT. &gt; It pisses me off so much when you simpletons act like a game has to make a complete 90 degree turn every time a new sequel hits the shelves... yet you're COMPLETELY fine with Call of Duty being (and quite literally) the same fucking game every fucking year.Nobody mentioned Call of Duty. Oh, and there is nothing wrong with liking call of duty by the way. It's a fun game. Yeah it gets released every year with minor changes but it's still a **fun game**. That's what Halo 4 was, it was different but it was still a good time and saying it's "not halo" because you don't have to run to the nearest non-shitty weapon to survive doesn't mean its the most godawful thing ever made.	halo	1383681742

Well they have options now. If you're tired of Halo 4 there are so many other fantastic titles out you can do anything.Halo 3 had barely any competition at the time, and Reach had to compete with Modern Warfare 3 which... had lots of its own issues. 	halo	1383692009
I just don't understand how you can agree w/ CoD having "no real gaming value". It's a game! It already has value!People buy and have fun playing it! That's all it has to accomplish! There's no deep message or meaning or any of that shit involved here. If you're going to go watch a Transformers movie, what are you expecting out of it? Yeah, it is annoying that the series is getting more broken and rehashed, but don't you tell me it doesn't have "gaming value" when you and 4 of your friends are tearing up an aircraft carrier with helicopters and drones. 	gaming	1383692330

A group in one of my classes did a radio report on this and it just seems really stupid to me.It's good that they're trying to get people to stop smoking, but banning EVERYTHING containing nicotine is not a good way to go about it.

But you obviously can't make alcohol illegal. Meth isn't nearly as widespread of a substance and thus seemingly easier to shut down operations of.IMO "legalization" won't matter in the next decade as pharmaceutical drugs become more widespread, accessible, and better than their "illegal" counterparts. 	pics	1387088376
&gt; Actually we did, and it birthed a whole organized crime circuit in the US because of itYeah that was my point, you can't do it today because alcohol is so ingrained in our culture and when we did try before it failed spectacularly. &gt; Also please point me in the direction of an over the counter pharmaceutical that will get me high like drinking alcohol or smoking weed that is also legal and I will be right on that.I didn't mean over-the-counter at all, and alcohol is already legal and medicinal marijuana is getting turned into all sorts of fun things. I meant that prescription drug use such as Adderall, Oxycodone (and variants), and Xanax are becoming very widespread as more and more people get them prescribed.I -think- that as that quantity increases they will start to compete with things like meth/heroin etc as they accomplish nearly the same effects but with much better regulation as every pill is easily identifiable. I can't cite any stats offhand but from my experience and based on what I have heard/read from other people, this seems to be a trend.

idk where you are pulling this info out of, especially that last bit.Just because kids are impatient and lazy doesn't mean there's a problem with our system. Everyone would rather be doing something -fun- instead of attending lectures or doing hw but thats just how life is.

&gt;  What do they need to read for if their aspiration is to work at their cousin's auto shop?

So your solution is to dumb the education down? That's not going to help at all.

now that I know what your stance is specifically I understand your original point more.

The thing is that I don't think they're musicians. I think their music is the product of many people working behind the scenes to create an image to sell to people.

An exploration program would require funding, and after glancing over /r/news and some other headlines ive read the past year, our government is massively in debt, our education is underfunded, and many cities are doing very poorly financially.Don't get me wrong, I'd love for an exploration program, but as someone in this thread has said, going back to the moon wouldn't really accomplish anything.

I'm probably in the minority here but I enjoyed Halo 4 + Reach a lot.

If anything we should always be promoting innovation and sounds that push what is considered "the norm" in order to get some sort of progression. If everyone made music for bud light commercials, we wouldn't have new and creative forms of music that would eventually make their way into those commercials in the future. I'm just saying it's not "bad" that they're doing it, but it's not wrong that people are calling it "bad". Besides, if he's really happy with where he is, why would he give a shit what people think about his creative choices?	electronicmusic	1390898272
the fantastic thing about "dubstep being dead" is that the people left still making it are really coming out with some good stuff, and not just riding the bandwagon	trap	1390899343
I always thought of "selling out" as meaning an artist has totally forsaken what they started out to do and just started making simple pop music. Like the [Black Eyed Peas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUormcZIgg0) before Fergie and now after. I think there's definitely some sort of compromise going on between music being an art and a job, and when one becomes valued more than the other you're always going to alienate people who liked the original.So I guess its really a problem with how people use the word carelessly when it really implies something more serious than whats going on here 	electronicmusic	1390899753

I agree but I don't think it should be enforced. More like, "strongly recommended" if there is a *chance* that things could go wrong. It's in a persons biology to want to have children, and there are some inherent problems with denying them that right. I like the idea overall, and maybe it will even be necessary for society in the future. Maybe we'll get really good at finding out what traits cause what disabilities and be able to somehow remove them. As of right now however, I don't think it would be a wise decision. It's ethically fucked, up there with mandating people to exercise or eating healthy. While those are overall -good- things, is it really right to FORCE people to do that?It's pretty damn totalitarian to tell people they can't have kids because of reasons, but if the system is perfected, perhaps it could be for the best. tl;dr - hypothetically yes, realistically no 	changemyview	1391120151
Yeah I hate how it's considered "harsh". It sounds bad to say out loud, but being not-disabled is *clearly* better than being disabled, and shouldn't we try to move towards a society where everyone is born without a handicap?	changemyview	1391123586

That's basically what I meant, she's just a part of a team of people who create "Miley Cyrus".

It's pretty much Dubstep. But not dubstep as you probably know it. 	AskReddit	1392964860
Sure thing, many people associate Dubstep now with [this sort of sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wCgxkQj_Qo), especially since acts like Skrillex, Excision, Bassnectar, and whatever else played in Youtube videos started hitting it off with audiences.However, the sound originally started out much [deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USMcgXvsdXA) and [darker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1dPyzx1IQA), meant for huge sound systems and revolving around atmosphere created by the massive subbass present in the tracks, as opposed to the more "party" inspired songs. I guess it's similar to the difference between Rap and underground hip-hop in a way. The issue is that at no point did people start to differentiate between the older, deeper sound focused on atmosphere and bass and the newer sound focused on catchy hooks and melodies, and everyone has a different opinion of who is right and wrong. **tl;dr**:  Burial's sound is closer to the [2-step/Garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0esicxpPEQ) that dubstep emerged from rather than the [call of duty montage theme music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXj1ijcAfew) it ended up (that's the worst possible example i could find, i think its hilarious). There's nothing *wrong* with liking one style over the other, but it did get way saturated for a while and nobody knew wtf was what.

It's in a public space. What do you think its there for? For ARRESTING DISSIDENTS or to stop dipshits from spraypainting and stealing things? There's a huge difference between wiretapping and public surveillance. Mind you, all this does is give an extra set of eyes to a street where hundreds of people can already see you and take pictures of you and so on. 	pics	1399532938
&gt; So it's not for our safety but for the safety from spending $$ to repair damage.That was just but one example where public surveillance could come in handy. Mostly its to dissuade crime. Who is going to attempt a robbery or some other type of vandalism when there is a camera that -could- be watching them? It helps private business owners and those who walk home late at night. I don't know where you live but there are definitely areas that could use this sort of thing.Just because there's a camera on the corner of a building does not mean it signifies some kind of 1984 type scenario. Owning a gun doesn't make you a murderer so why would a camera turn us into a police state? What are you doing out in public that would attract that attention of authorities anyway? Also as some other comments have stated, this isn't some super deep message about sacrificing freedom for security. It's just a camera on a flagpole. Yeah you can extrapolate whatever you want from it, but like i said there's a huge difference between warrantless wiretapping and public surveillance. Do you get upset at the cameras inside of stores? Why is this different? 	pics	1399534784
Don't tell me I'm brushing off or excusing this with "bullshit". You should know the world isn't in black and white and saying "Surveillance is bad" is a blanket statement which does not help your case, which is the implication I'm getting from your post. [This article says that crime rates did drop in some areas with cameras](http://gcn.com/articles/2011/09/20/surveillance-cameras-effect-on-preventing-crimes.aspx) and i'm inclined to agree with it. Like I said, just because I think public surveillance isn't that bad doesn't mean I agree with the NSA or the data-mining it does. Either way, I don't think anyone on this website is going to see this picture and think "wow yeah, that's totally right" considering the stance against the NSA has become so polarized you have to wonder if the truth is somewhere in the middle. 	pics	1399535907

You gotta do the side-quests to level up. Generally, if you're 1-2 levels higher than the main quest you're about take on you'll be on good shape. Dying isn't a big deal so don't fret if you die a lot, especially if you haven't developed your skill tree much. You have to play a bit carefully in the beginning, but once you get a hang of your character and find out what guns you're best with it gets infinitely easier. 	Borderlands2	1400149569

I don't think that's "giving up" really. He plays live a lot and makes music that is best for a live audience. All of his songs (dubstep at least) are pretty simple and repetitive to listen to, but sound fantastic when mixed and heard in context of a DJ mix. It's not like he sits there and thinks "ok now i will write a song in Bb Minor!" im pretty sure he just fucks around with sounds he likes and makes shit from that 	dubstep	1402898739
I don't get why people want him to make Dubstep again. I don't like knife party/monstercat/whatever either but there are so so so many amazing producers right now pushing the boundaries its pointless to get stuck up on "what was good in 2006"I can see why he'd get upset too... dude has been making tracks for a decade+ and some dude thinks its unprofessional? 	dubstep	1402905907

no man, in ALL professionally recorded music. Its just an extra step to take in ensuring you get the best possible recording for release. Most of the time you can't even tell because its a *subtle* effect.

Fair enough, I've studied Music Technology (mostly producing) for 3+ years now and I've definitely had a few classes describing the uses of auto tune and its benefits. In my musical sphere "classical singing" doesn't even really enter the picture, so I cant speak to that. But dismissing everyone who uses auto-tune as "untalented" hardly seems fair when its widespread.At this point I think it'd be like blaming someone for using an EQ. Yeah it changes the original sound, but it does so to make the overall song more pleasant to listen to. Not all music is there to show off musicianship 	funny	1404554305

the 3 stooges are funny because they get hurt at their own expense. He's right, most humor comes from a feeling of superiority over another subject 	AdviceAnimals	1405376898

Im not attacking, its just that humor often comes from a certain place. There was some sociological (or whathaveyou) article I read that stated that we find things funny because we look down on the people/subjects involved. The 3 stooges are funny because they are idiots and we feel better than them. The guys in The Hangover are the same. So following this line, racist jokes are "funny" because you feel that youre better than the people portrayed 	AdviceAnimals	1405377374
I wasn't saying that it's not "funny", i was asking WHY it was funny. When these sorts of jokes get perpetuated, they carry a certain connotation to them. You know the line "how does every black joke start? By looking over your shoulder." it already creates a divide because that person KNOWS its offensive and then says it anyway. As far as it being not true, the [superiority theory](http://www.iep.utm.edu/humor/#SH2a) offers that in -many- cases, it is affecting what we find funny. I'm not saying you should never make tasteless jokes or laugh at them.

I don't think so. Dubstep is defined by structure, that's how you can have [really spacious, minimal songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkphxycZwI4) as well as [busy, heavy ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sptx-ESBvlA) and still have them be in the same genre.Synth sounds aren't confined to any genre, you can have a wobble bass in anything but that doesn't necessarily mean it's related to dubstep.If Beethoven had a symphony that was 140bpm with a halftime snare and lots of subbass... then sure that could have dubstep elements. This schoolboy song isn't dubstep just because its at something like 174 beats per minute	dubstep	1406513111

It felt like a multiplayer Mass Effect in a way. You had the ability to free roam, explore the world, and you never felt alone because of all the other people doing the same. It's similar to Grand Theft Auto online, although much more thought out IMO. The gameplay was fun too, although it didn't really make sense in the Beta (why are there so many vendors for similar items?)I do agree with you about the story not being particularly strong, most of the time I just took it as an indication of "k go over there and shoot dudes, got it". Hopefully that's going to be much more coherent in the final game. 	roosterteeth	1406522258

My point was that I don't understand this need to look down upon new technology. I see comments on reddit all the time about how "huehue my nokia never crashed" or "my n64 never red-ringed!" and I think that's a stupid attitude. The reason those things happen is because those the devices are incredibly complex and achieve functions we couldn't even dream of back then.Same with the car. If a car accident were to occur (-accident- because NOBODY ever plans on crashing into things, so saying "well just dont crash into anything" also doesnt make any sense) you'd probably walk away thanks to things like seatbelts, airbags, and crumple zones.	pics	1406528755
Yeah I'm familiar. That and the need for proprietary tools is really a negative side effect that's going to be a reeaal pain in the ass later on.

Fortunately the Android platform lets you wipe the device and get a new ROM in, but I have read that Samsung is trying their best to restrict this from happening.I think overall the upsides still outweigh the downs anyway, cuz at least you can use your phone to search for why it runs like shit!	pics	1406542305

I don't understand the need to find competition between PCs and Chromebooks. They aren't nearly the same. PC's have the advantage of raw computing power, applications, and harddrives, while Chromebooks are more akin to tablets in that they are portable and small.

Why is that the users problem? If you want to make money from your work, that's your issue to figure out. The "content creators" should know how to work around adblock and monetize if they expect to succeed. 	reactiongifs	1407503059
I understand the sentiment but I disagree with whom the responsibility lies.If someone becomes a musician and isn't cutting even it's not the audiences fault for their lack of success. They have to be the ones to find a way to reach out. If you're trying to support yourself being an artist, drawing webcomics or w/e then you should know what you're getting into and it's not the users obligation to help you. If they do that's great but definitely not something you should expect.There are always going to be people who pirate video games and use Adblock on every site.

When a popular style develops and gains traction there are many producers who try to emulate those sounds since there's clearly a market for it. It could be straight out of a sample pack (ProducerLoop43: insta-Melodic Dubstep or something) or its probably made in a synthesizer since its not a terribly complex sound. Electronic music has a lot of consistency and emulation so many songs end up sounding very similar, and the more popular genres get oversaturated with these sounds so it gets very generic very fast. Sure many producers probably just like that sound and want to use it, but I don't believe its all genuine intent. Hope that answers your question. Source: am producer	OutOfTheLoop	1409624825

The cutscenes and the graphics looked -amazing- for a game running on 8 year old hardware. I enjoyed the campaign although it made no sense the first time around (had to do some serious research on wtf the Librarian/Didact were all about). Fighting the Prometheans got irritating though, especially on harder difficulties when the Knights would just teleport away when you were about to kill them, or one shot you with some ridiculous weapon. I'd say its still a good time though. Not the best one in the series but good enough to keep you interested, and having Spartan Ops was a great addition as well to fill the time.Multiplayer wise its way different and a lot of people didn't like it. I think we're past the era of Halo 1/2/3 style gameplay and the sprinting/classes/call of duty type things are going to be ingrained in future games so there's no fighting that. The online maps are all very meh though. No big "areas" to converge on, no more fighting for prime locations, just seems like everyone is wandering around aimlessly until they fight an enemy.Most of the maps have way too many lines of sight at any given time so it gets frustrating when you get shot at and have no idea where it could be coming from.I played pretty much only SWAT though so those problems weren't *as* apparent as in Team Slayer.**tl;dr:** It's a fun game, but its a departure from the Halo style.

There's clearly a way to make things louder without making them sound distorted and fucking awful. I think it's a it general to say it's what "everybody" wants as I've noticed in my circles that the only qualms with "quieter" sounding music is that its just a pain to mix with newer tracks. Peak a little here and there and it's all fine but you can tell when something is just clipped to shit without any thought given, and in my experience those tracks are going to sound unprofessional to your peers. As for people, well "people" think its fine to listen to dubstep on their cellphones so honestly I dont think they opinion matters too much when it comes to these matters	edmproduction	1410165252

A very large percentage of those medical holders use it solely as a loophole to skirt the law. I realize that abstinence is an awful policy. But discouraging others from driving while under the influence is not. I don't believe encouraging the mindset that "oh you'll be fine if you drink a few beers and drive home" is a good one. Even though under the current laws you would be legally in the clear (if you're under a .08), the societal pressure would at least cause you to consider alternatives for transportation, like calling a cab, getting a DD, etc.The problem with pot is that there isn't really any way to tell what a "legal limit" is. I believe that by discouraging smoking + driving we won't necessarily cause the problem to go away, but it would at least cause some people to be more careful about it.

New releases for PC cost $60 as well. Not all console games cost $60. I picked up Witcher 2 for something like $6, and they now give away games for free twice every month. 	gaming	1412707884
Yeah and I just said that console games can be free too. Either way if you're buying a AAA title when it releases, it's going to cost about $60, and if you only buy 1-2 games a year that figure is negligible. My original question is about the initial cost. A PS4 costs $400, can you get a comparable PC for $400? If yes, then yeah why don't more people build PCs + get controllers? If not, then that means there's clearly a certain market for consoles that can't be met with a personality built computer.  Ironically there's a certain stability to that, since my 6 year old Xbox will still play whatever games I throw at it with ease, but my 5 year old laptop can barely run TF2 anymore. 	gaming	1412709104

And again, it's free, open source, super lightweight, and if you have the knowledge you can do some powerful things with it. If you don't like it, then just don't use it. Nobody is forcing you to. But don't say that people only use it to be "Linux hipsters" because thats just ignorant bullshit. 	pcmasterrace	1413966623
&gt; I also asked what made it better than windows, and what it did differently that would make it a decent choice. I said "it's free, open source, super lightweight, and if you have the knowledge you can do some powerful things with it." Here's some [article](http://www.pcworld.com/article/246866/10_reasons_to_switch_to_linux_in_2012.html) that lists some shit as well.Also, gaming isn't the only reason to use a computer. If it's that important to you then yeah stick to Windows. But for many people (like me... just said my GPU is fucked up n linux lets me browse the web at least) it's a good choice. Some people like the fact that, again, its free and open source and they can support developers and contribute themselves and install it on old computers to use as servers and all kinds of shit like that. Some like cuz its similar to OS X but also way cheaper to run. And, you mentioned people shoving it down each others throat? Dude this is /r/pcmasterrace.

I don't see how that's a "sad" thing from an employers perspective. Would you rather work with your friend, who you know isn't insane, won't steal, and will do his job at least competently, or some random guy from the street?Also getting grades is a process in of itself. Half the point of high school/college is learning how to manage workloads and working in groups. Most of us aren't going to have to remember Chemistry or the 7 years war, but writing those essays and studying for those tests taught us a process that we are going to use all the time.	Showerthoughts	1414041306
Not every position is filled by networking. Random guy on the street still has as good of a chance as anyone else at applying and getting in based on his qualifications, AND he can ALSO make connections to prove to people that he is easy to work with. Again, think of it from an employer perspective. The whole reason you want to have a resume is to prove that you worked in the past and that people tolerated you.Making connections is a skill like any other, I don't see why it's so frowned upon on reddit. Your example of Paul Ryan is not demonstrative of the entire educational system. There are plenty of people who studied hard, made connections, and got a leg up on the competition because someone said "hey yeah i know that guy, he knows his stuff".I'm hoping this analogy is as effective as I think, but think of it in terms of dating. Yeah you could go on online profiles and you might get a match, but isn't it much better to look into your personal circle and find someone you know you already have common ground with?As far as grades go, they're just a measuring tool. In my college experience, when you graduate all you're left with are the skills you picked up on the way. If you didn't turn in assignments, you lacked discipline. If you didn't do well its because you either didn't prepare or you did a bad job. I did more or less alright, but I learned how to manage time well and how to coordinate things to get done.

You can easily get some cheap lights for $20-$30 each. Put them far enough away from a speaker to react to the sound and it'll do great for a house party	DJs	1415567980
I have those and while they do react to the sound they are really fucking bright, like shit will blind you if it shines into your eyes so I recommend either putting a bag or something that diffuses the light over them.

Also stick a bag over it and you'll get some great ambient lighting that changes with the beat (if you stick it close enough to a subwoofer).The problem with cheap lighting is that it either breaks or it just looks ugly. I have the 2 types that I listed and they've been working fine, but you just have to get creative with placement and diffusion to make them less obnoxious. Also spend some money on blacklights.

Sure he started a trend that got real popular, but if you look around now, especially in places like /r/realdubstep, he had little impact there.

I always think its a bit difficult to find music similar to a vibe without just buying into an artists/labels entire discography. However due to much diminished traffic now I think it would be better to expand over 2-3 days instead. It would be interesting to have a "theme" for 3 days and encourage posts for that particular style, if only to see what people come up with.

Its forced exclusivity. I'm starting to see it a lot with deep dubstep especially, tracks get hyped up forever and then released in limited amounts in an attempt to get people out to see DJs play "that one track". It's fine if you keep things as dubplates but if youre going to release it.. just fucking release it then.As someone mentioned, some guy with a decent setup is just going to rip it for everyone who couldnt buy it anyway. At least by pressing more they'd be better of financially 	realdubstep	1417840508
Thanks for typing all that, I see your perspective. However I was more referring to actual released music rather than dubplates and such. I've got no qualms with producers holding on to tracks or keeping them within a tight group of people. As a DJ its really something special to have a stellar track that only *you* have and if you're friends with people like Loefah... well you'll have some incredible sets that will keep people coming back.It's just that when a track is finally released to the public it seems kind of strange to keep supply limited unnecessarily. I think the only people who are really winning there are those buy up the supply and then re-sell them later. Then they sell out of the 300 copies and anyone who actually wants to buy the tracks is going to have to either shell out on discogs, or pirate them. None of that is coming back to the artist. If it's going to end up on the internet anyway, why not control that distribution I'd be happier with them doing a limited, special edition run and then releasing it en masse later on so anyone into the music can get a copy if they want. 	realdubstep	1417852965

The thing is, everyone thinks their issues are real. The people yelling "trigger warning" might think their issues are as serious as your panic attacks are to you.

I understand, but how can you even tell if they're doing what you're describing (using it as a crutch to attack other people) or if they've got some shit going on behind the scenes?I think it comes down to just treating everyone based on how they act regardless of whether or not they have some kind of issue influencing them. But doesn't that become dangerous if you don't take someone seriously when there IS something going on, and you thought they were just acting out for attention?I haven't really come to a conclusion on any of this yet so thats why im asking. I understand it can be frustrating when "anxiety" comes to mean anything from feeling slightly nervous to a debilitating panic attack, but when the only person who can say whether its a real issue is the one who has it things get complicated.

Again, just because you don't care about the difference doesn't mean there isn't one. It's definitely not arbitrary though. You not "giving a fuck" about genres is good for you but when you open a DAW, you enter a bpm number, and produce in a consistent time signature you are effectively choosing a genre anyway. Categorization is not a bad thing.,	SubredditDrama	1422054770
that wasn't my point.It doesn't matter what YOU have in mind - whatever you make is going to fall into some kind of category anyway. If it's at 170bpm in half-time it might be some kind of drum &amp; bass or hip hop, if its at 126 in 4/4 it may be techno or house.These genres/sub-genres exist objectively and there are many people who hear a song and think "this is deep house" whereas you may say "well its just edm". That doesn't mean one is somehow better than another or that the person who can tell the difference is some kind of "nitpicking hipster"	SubredditDrama	1422056403

It matters to some. The intent does have to change at some point as not all music has the capacity to be popular enough to be self-sustaining (let alone make you wealthy). I don't like listening to songs and knowing that there was a team of producers and a mass marketing campaign that tried to make it catchy. I do like listening to artists who make it because they enjoy the art and want to share it with others.The two can overlap, and probably do a lot. We really have no way to know if someone is 'in it for they money' or just happened to become popular. But I don't think someone making music just to sell it is in it for "the right reasons", whatever that means.Call it elitism if you want, but I'd like less forms of media where something is trying to sell itself to you. 	todayilearned	1423656335

You're not supposed to take it literally. The point is that at some point you're going to look around and think everything is shit and you're shit. You're supposed to realize that this happens to everyone and that you're not alone. Everyone has insecurities that they're painfully aware of, just like you have some thing you're probably trying to work out as well. OPs advice is that you have to realize you're not the only one going through struggles and if everyone else somehow made it, you probably will too. 	AskReddit	1424409449
Why's it horrible? Isn't it comforting to think that whatever you're going through, other people go through too? If you break your arm and think "wow holy shit this is the worst thing to have ever happened to me, how will i go on", isn't it good to know that others have suffered the same, and have since moved on?I think that's the point. To know that even when things seem really dark, others have made it out, and you will too. 	AskReddit	1424410407

I think there is a shift towards DJs also being part promoters and producers. Now that DJing has become accesible, the best way to stand out is to have technique + song selection. If you've got loads of unreleased tunes from your friends/labels, you will have an audience no matter what since you are the only person who can mix that particular selection.  Wedding DJs may be out of the job, but I imagine more people will  want to go and see DJs play out as the main performance rather than someone assisting the event. That's my hope anyway.

I believe that the focus just shifted over the years. Dubstep was 'the hot new thing' a year ago (or so) and we had tons of content relating to festival headliners and the high-energy melodic songs you described. Now the focus just switched over to deeper side of things. People who are finding about Dubstep NOW are going through different channels than before. That's just the nature of music genres. I don't think its a matter of asking people to expand their horizons, since they won't. Everyone has a specific idea of what 'dubstep' is and that's what they expect to hear here. When they don't they think 'wtf is this , this isn't what i signed up for'.It sucks that some just downvote things they dont like but thats the unfortunate nature of this site. I can't think of a solution to that other than to slap more signs up that say 'dont be a dick'. As far as new producers go - well it's easier to trust a label/channel/submitter/DJ than to click randomly. What do you look for when you try to find new music? A cool sounding name? It's hard to hook people in with no expectations - so they always go to the familiar. I think partially when new producers post their own tracks here they have a habit of overstating themselves. 'Hey im 12 years old and this is my first song' is not appealing to me. If you post and get ignored thats just the way life works. Its a grind like anything else. Ive been posting my own tracks here for like 3 years now and just now have they had any sort of positive reaction. Regardless of some of my disagreements, I do appreciate you taking the type to write your post. It's good to see that the community is self-aware and wants to take action against possible problems. 	dubstep	1425297378

Find a forum or community and become involved in it. Maybe an IRC chat or something similar. But for the love of god don't show up and say "hey someone listen to this". You wouldn't show up to a random persons door and ask whats for dinner without introducing yourself would you?You just need to develop a network of people with similar music interests and skills who will give you honest feedback, even when you don't want to hear it, and whose tracks you can listen to and give feedback for as well.	edmproduction	1429829144

You don't have to mod your game to play it.You could play Skyrim or whatever without installing a single mod. So yea, doesn't affect base game. It's not necessary, it's entirely optional. Your experience doesn't become worse because some guy wants $10 for his skins. 	gaming	1429833277
I do have experience with modding. I modded Skyrim to ADD to my game experience, to make the base game (that I already had a good time playing) more interesting. I'm glad it was free and easy to deal with, but if people want to charge for the content they create, why shouldn't they be able to? Do they owe it to you to make free mods? Again, you don't NEED to replace all the swords with lightsabers to play Skyrim. It's something entirely extra and optional. So yeah, it sucks that something that used to be free is no longer free, and the system is clearly easily abused, but making threads like 'RIP PC Gaming' is a serious hyperbole. 	gaming	1429833747
I do see the problem. For modding. Not for PC gaming as a whole 	gaming	1429844065

I'd say that is objective. Your arrangement of sounds is fine, and the mix itself is alright (altho I can't really hear the percussion/hats ).In general Dubsteps rhythm is driven by the relationship between the percussion line and the subbass. Everything else just complements these things and the kick/snare + synths give the listener something to concentrate on.I also think you should get more creative with your synth design because as Zeepsopsop said, at this point this sort of thing has been done already. You mentioned some synths you used and Massive/Sylenth are great starting points and are very powerful when you get more into them, especially once you start adding effect automation into the mix too.I'd say check out IL Harmor and Xfer Serum as well since they function a bit differently and might inspire some ideas in you. 	dubstep	1432328356

I don't understand the hardon reddit has for self-driving cars. For one,  I can't see them doing a good job where there aren't obvious roads and two, they are going to be EXPENSIVE as all hell. New luxury models are using some features like braking for you (for whatever stupid reason), and I highly doubt the average middle class american is going to trade in his honda civic for one of those anytime soon. 100 years is a long time, ill give you that, but I'd hope at that point we're beyond using cars and will have finally developed public transport that doesn't entirely suck.

I think he was saying you don't need certain hardware to 'make it'. I produce electronic music and there are many people who are just starting out who keep asking for what the best gear is and what they need to buy to make them better. In reality you can get by with just a keyboard + mouse. You don't need fancy synthesizers to make music just like you don't need an expensive guitar. In his case, you don't need a computer to have fun playing music with your friends. 	GetMotivated	1436224775

Nah they were definitely shooting for 5 minutes straight without reloading. It kind of drew me out, it couldn't have been that hard to just shoot less.

I only caught 2 instances of them actually showing that. There are still bits of Colin Farrell shooting like 20 bullets in a sequence and stuff like that.It's a really minor thing but if they had like 2-3 more scenes of people reloading it would have killed this criticism off quick. For a show thats this grounded in reality I don't see why they dont.And lets not forget the guy duel wielding towards the end...

You realize they banned FPH because they were brigading and harassing members of the community right? Not because of some moral outrage? 	announcements	1436912923
There have been like... tons of posts explaining this. /r/SRS doesn't brigade that much. Most people who say "wah SRS is downvoting me" are full of it because their shitty post got downvoted.That and they keep it mostly under control. Your 2nd thing is pure speculation. Until an admin actually comes out and says "yea we want the site to not be a racist and sexist infested shithole so we can make more money", it really doesn't matter. And even if they did, can you explain to me why you WOULD want a subreddit making fun of people front and centre? 	announcements	1436918368
FPH was banned for harassing users. Not for being "demeaning" Although, honestly I wouldn't mind for that to be a reason too 	announcements	1436918402
Content policy decides what is offensive. Whatever thing they draw up on thursday will determine this. Reddit is past the point of voting meaning anything. I'm sure you've seen the most asinine, idiotic content on the front page before. Why don't people downvote that? Moderators also define what's offensive. I'm a mod of a subreddit and we drew up a specific set of rules of what we want and don't want. I don't care how many upvotes or downvotes something gets - if it violates the rules it gets removed no matter what. I don't see a problem with banning hateful and inciteful posts. I use this site for general social reactions to news events, for reading peoples stories, and for interesting pictures. FPH was banned for different reasons than being offensive, but honestly, it was just bullying people anyway. Why would you want that kind of content?I'm probably biased because I do content moderation/enforcement for a living, but you need a policy with rules and you need people to enforce it because users are NOT good at doing it themselves. If you don't like this, you should start looking for a different site, because this seems to be the way things are going here. 	announcements	1436920109

tbh I don't understand what the point of recommending Tempa/Deep Medi, etc to people like this. I imagine for most people Dubstep made a name by being catchy and accessible, and by contrast the deep stuff will sound abstract and maybe boring. Count in the fact that the average listener probably has YouTube + desktop speakers as their access point, telling someone who listens to Skrillex to check out VIVEK just seems counterproductive to me. I know there is a middle ground (i usually tell people to listen to Joker and Silkie/Swindle)but ey it's not for everyone and that's fine. 	realdubstep	1441175829

$3000 for a room isn't a result of people "hustling hard", it's the result of others hustling THEM. The bay area has turned form a place of innovation to a place where people make startups with only the hopes of selling them. What about the fast food workers, the teachers and professors, the delivery drivers, and all those people? Should they all start working 80 hour weeks just to afford to keep their homes?Tell "hustle harder" to all the contractors who won't get hired on because corporations want to save money. Or what about non-poaching agreements between tech companies? That's the result of "hustling hard".Maybe I should start up a payday loan business to prey on the community to make rent. Since scraping and fighting is what its all aboutThis is all a very conservative way of looking at things. Not everyone has the advantage or the privlege of going back to school or having time to learn new skills. Personally I'm working for a top tech company here and I'm trying to move somewhere where I don't have to waste my life working for someone else just to afford to live. 	bayarea	1442010383
I don't mean you have to apologize for them but telling him he should "work harder" isn't really a solution. California is really fucking expensive to live in. There is no way around that, and working overtime may cause more stress than its worth. There's also nothing wrong with relocating to somewhere else. Maybe he'd be happier with equal/less pay but more affordable standards of living (plus less traffic and people).I didn't see your edit in your original post, but while I'm glad your way of thinking worked out for you, it's a systemic problem rather than a personal one here. 	bayarea	1442025528

Making it difficult for developers to work with the phone.The whole point of Android is supposed to be about letting the user customize their device (imo).

Yea I'm with you. I got an S6 Edge a while ago and while I love everything hardware wise the software leaves much to be desired.

If i remember correctly, as long as you're making payments you can swap your phone after 2 months. 12/24 months is just how long you make payments for before you own the phone. The whole point of the program was to let you upgrade frequently 	GalaxyS6	1443035349

Like any phone, it has some drawbacks but it depends on how willing you are to work with them. RAM management isn't fantastic but if you put some work into clearing the cache and limiting how many apps you have running at once you'll rarely notice it. I restart the phone when it gets noticeably slow and it usually resolves whatever problem I'm having.Battery life isn't amazing either but fast charging makes up for it. I just got a bunch of chargers and put them in strategic locations so I never see the battery dip below 50%.As far as the benefits - split screening apps is more useful than I thought, the camera is AMAZING, and the overall device feels sturdy and 'premium'. My only regret is getting when it first came out, so I'm going to be on the hook for paying for it for a loong time.  Overall you should wait to see what the Nexus 6P is all about, but right now I think the GS6 is the most powerful phone you can get, you just have to work with it on some issues 	GalaxyS6	1443470586

Yea i think they're just tangentially related because some people who like electronic music also like video games sometimes. There's nothing tying the two together in any meaningful way, since like treeizzle said, it's a form of music that came out of the 2000's UK rave scene.8-bit artists also don't really relate to dubstep in anyway. Honestly the only reason the genre is even as popular as it is is because artists from other genres decided to make some tracks when it was blowing up and now everyone associates them with dubstep (Feed me, Skrillex, knife party, etc)	dubstep	1443991213

Not all channels of communication are equal. You NEED a phone to communicate with the rest of the world. Not having a facebook is an inconvenience at most.

That's not nearly the same thing. You cannot submit a resume without a phone #. The government does not send you facebook messages when it needs to contact you. You don't use facebook to get a drivers license or apply for a house loan or open a bank accountAlso everyone else can see the shit you post and report you for it - that's how they look at your information in the first place. If you bitch over the phone about your job you won't get fired, but if the wrong person sees on facebook, you will be. Again, it's a PUBLIC sphere. It's a service started by a private corporation.

I don't think there's that much of a difference between FB and reddit .You're getting updates on topics you're interested in and participate in conversation with people. On Facebook its obviously more personal since you've personally added people, but the idea is the same. Someone shares a link and has a discussion about it.If you don't like what they're posting you unsub/unfollow 	AskReddit	1445362548
The world on reddit is black and white. You're either a privacy defying evil corporation or you can do no wrong. 	pcmasterrace	1445367388
YOU? No. I don't know who you are. I know what Google/Microsoft are and I know what they are trying to accomplish and I am ok with those goals.Thats why I clicked "i agree" on the EULA. If you hate it so much, stop using Windows. Stop using Facebook and stop using Google products. It sucks when companies do things you don't like but their services come with a cost. There are tons of alternatives on there for people who do care, and for those of us who don't, we're fine with it. Now that's not say it shouldn't be criticized, but to equate targeted ads and better search prediction with staring through your bathroom window is ridiculous.

Some people just don't care. It's a convenient platform and gives me cheap games. You don't have to buy any of these things and they don't affect gameplay at all. If they did that would be a different issue but its just cosmetic items. 	gaming	1446068188
Someone with this emote will have no advantage over you in pvp play, neither will anyone with a different weapon skin.Also CS:GO is $15 	gaming	1446072313
You get random weapon drops once in a while. Now all the weapons are mostly balanced so its not like you NEED them to play but it can definitely give you an edge if it fits your playstyle.You can trade for things but there is nothing you can with crates except open them with keys. It's basically gambling actually, because there's a small chance you'll get something super rare that's actually worth money. 	gaming	1446076569
I understand that view, but a lot of the time it's just cosmetics. If you want to pay $1 (or whatever) to customize your character then why not? Company gets more money to fund things and you support them.For DLC and content that should have been there, yea I agree that's annoying but I don't think these 2 things are tied together. e.g. While TF2 gets free maps but you generally have to spend money to get weapon skins and unique weapons, for Destiny you have to pay money for both. But this dance animation is really the wrong thing to attack.	gaming	1446076820

That's not nearly the same thing. Everyone benefits from there being more women in clubs. Did you see what I typed about more MEN being present as a result? It's supply and demand.

There's a specific reason people go to the type of places that have "ladies nights" or let women in at a discount/free, and that's not for any 'PC' These owners aren't saying "fuck men, we want only women in our clubs", they're changing the demographics to make them more appealing to everyone.

Are people going to this club to hook up with asians? Is there a cultural precedence with which people go to this place to meet and dance with asians? Also again.MORE MEN SHOW UP AS A RESULT.

Most are totally fine, are FREE and require little commitment from its members (you can just stop showing up whenever you want)Seriously man, go to a regular church, then visit a scientology center and try to argue that they are the same. 	worldnews	1448323549

But isn't that the point? Getting good at anything is hard. You pretty much immediately face obstactles that arent fun and that push you to want to do absolutely anything else.e.g. if you want to get into shape you have to go to the gym no matter how much you don't want to or how unmotivated you are. You have to force yourself to do it as many times as you can even when it's absolutely the last thing you want to do. I think discipline is more important than motivation and thats what OP is getting at. If you really, and I mean really, put your 100% into doing a thing (within reason, like you said if you're not inclined at all to be a cook you'd just hate every second of it) then you would eventually get real good at it.

Only thing is that the infrastructure for dealerships already exists. They don't need to change anything to recieve newer models of cars.There are some services already like http://beepi.com which will get you a car but I wonder how many people actually use their services. If you buy a car once every 10-15 years then it seems easier to just deal with the pain of dealing with a dealership rather than trying a new service out and hoping they're still around in a month if something goes wrong. 	technology	1451952051
This all just seems like an attempt to fix something that isn't broken. There's no need to replace car ownership, we just need something to work alongside it.If ridesharing/renting a car every week is more of a pain in the ass than outright buying one then it won't take over. Besides, people are still driving cars from the 80s on the road, so whatever technological shift happens will take decades upon decades to finally trickle down to the rest of the population.	technology	1451953426
&gt; Cities for example could completely eliminate parkingHow long do you think before the majority of commuters would even use this? Also how long before it's even economically viable to use them rather than paying for gas yourself?	technology	1451954511
My point initially is that if you overcomplicate a simple process then you will create more points at which it can fail. When you own a car you are only interacting with that 1 vehicle. You keep up on maintnence, you choose where it goes, you plan your trips. When you  give up control over those things, the hope is that someone takes care of those problems in a way that's more efficient, and I skeptical about this working out smoothly in autonomous vehicles. But I could be wrong.Also, I own my car outright. I spend about 1.5 hours sitting in traffic (which is what i'd love to have a self driving car for, so don't get me wrong there.) I also pay roughly $40 every 2 weeks for gas.But I enjoy having the convenience of having access to it at all times. If I need to load some things up and park it in a driveway, I can do that. Same with taking long trips (not sure how Uber will handle giving up one of their cars for a 2 hour drive, much less what that would cost).I think your statement of 75% is very optimistic, and even then it might only work in large cities where there is less reliance on transporting yourself anyways. I live in the Silicon Valley, so I'd probably see whatevers on the horizon first and at this point I don't think there is any indication of car ownership going away. In fact, I see more new cars on the road every month. They're a big status symbol as well so that's also going to be a difficult thing to move away from (I say status because since this is california, we're all sitting in traffic all day anyways and it's not that much better in a Tesla than a Ford)Also, then you are at the mercy of your ridesharing company. Uber did a massive price hike a week ago for New Years. if you NEED to get somewhere during that time, what are you going to do?	technology	1451957652

&gt; WhyWe like to believe we live in a meritocracy. I'd like to believe that things that get popular get that way because they are good, not because they've been somehow manipulated to be that way.Oscars 'should' be awarded to good films. Talented musicians 'should' be on the radio.We know the world isn't like this, but shouldn't we aspire to make it more so?	AskReddit	1452200934
That's not my point at all. I don't care about what the radio stations play now and never did I call it inferior. I don't care what you listen to, and I never said there should be laws to prevent this.Look at this way, do you think people who work hard at your job should be promoted? That's the way its supposed to work right? If you are good at something, you are rewarded for being good at it. If you bust your ass at your job all year you would like to get a raise or promotion instead of someone who didn't do shit and just kissed ass all year right?If your answer to that is yes, then are musicians who spent their lives perfecting their art deserving of radio play? Or should it instead go to 18 producer/writer staffed teams that deliberately write catchy hits for an artist that's just there for the image? I'm not saying there's something "wrong" with the second option, but I would personally RATHER hear the first persons work be rewarded than the second. I think that as a society we should value raw talent and hard work over promotional material. I know that that's not how the world works, and that radio stations are all syndicated and owned by other media companies anyway, but I'd LIKE for it to be that way. 	AskReddit	1452205069
I don't think so. Dubwise is just dubstep with more reggae shit and kicks, I don't think its different enough to merit a name. As for the weird experimental stuff it's barely even Dubstep at that point so I just throw it under the all encompassing "bass music" umbrella 	realdubstep	1452205465

Again, I'm speaking from an ideological standpoint. I *know* that those things are required to become successful. Also, working hard does not have to =/= working effectively, that just depends on your definition of the term. I was trying to show that most people believe we should be rewarded based on merit. I don't understand why you are disregarding that. Ideologically, I would prefer it if musicians who wrote their own pieces achieved a greater level of success than those who have a team of producers/writers and a financial incentive. That's all I'm trying to get at. In an *ideal world*, you'd have DJs play music they think is good, not music that their parent company is paid to promote. 	AskReddit	1452210282

angello gets 0/💯	electronicmusic	1453408052
I own the S2.It is 💯 . One of, if not the, best purchases I've made. First off, even if you get a sub, worrying about room treatment and reflections would be a tremendous pain in the ass. Subpac disregards all that by simply putting the bass directly into your spine.It's also AMAZING for movies, shows, video games, etc. Feeling the low subsonic tone as the tension builds in a scene is something special.There are no cons to it. Well, I don't know if it's actually good for your back or not, and I haven't felt the actual back of my chair in a year now but disregarding that I'd say its 100% worth it. Keep in mind it needs a 3.5mm connection so you'll need to figure out someway to add it to your setup. Plugging it into the headphone port on your interface or computer should be fineBut I make dubstep/bass music so having subbass is VERY important. 	edmproduction	1453420062
I disagree with the "plan it" people. Find your style and develop it. Then once you have a grasp on what you're good at, apply it to other styles.If you say "i'm going to make a hip hop tune" you are going to be frustrated if you make anything else. if you start out with "I'm just gonna play around with stuff at 110bpm" (or whatever) you won't have rigid expectations set. Then once you have the groundwork you can be like "ok mb I could add elements from something else"Not to say you shouldn't try new things, but if you're viewing it as forcing yourself then ask yourself why. You don't HAVE to make a specific type of music. For the longest time i've tried to make dubstep and it just never really came out that great. Then I started experimenting with techno elements and combined the two, and had much better success and fun. 	edmproduction	1453420648

If I had spent less time gaming and more time studying and doing something productive when I was 20 I'd be in a much better position than I am now. If you learn how to play the guitar there's a chance that you will start creating music and have a creative output. Hell you could even play with people and release music.

That said Nvidia has apparently done some scummy things (i guess the whole 3.5gb thing was a big deal, i didnt really follow the rest) so I can see where the resentment might come from.

In fact he's probably just talking shit because he knows thats what his voter base wants to hear. It's working too.

Like what? Offering sales? They are both companies that are trying to make money so they can keep existing. I don't think MS is the devil for trying to get into the game as well. I think its hypocritical to praise steam but condemn origin, uplay, and now the MS store. I remember a decade ago everyone despised steam. If the other platforms have more time to evolve i'm sure they'll get up to its current caliber soon enough. As for MS - they released W10 for free which many people are totally happy with. Not everyone has the option to switch to linux just because they agree with the OS on an ideological basis. In fact, most people don't mind the data mining that happens because it doesn't affect at all. At the end of the day, if a game looks fun (and runs well) I am going to buy it regardless of whether it uses DX12 or Vulkan. I disagree with your statement that we're all going to "lose" something here. 	pcmasterrace	1458327458

He could plant evidence on you and ruin your life based on fabricated evidence.Ok but I am not afraid of this happening right now either. Genghis_trons example is pretty extreme but all it does is say that you could get fucked up by the system - not that a bigger access to data will make it more likely to happen.Making sharper knives doesn't mean people are going to get stabbed more often - it also leads to better cooking and cutting of (ok i lost my own analogy here but bear with me) other useful things.I work for a company that deals with large amounts of user data. Is it possible that someone could fuck over a user with this information? Pretty much not because the company doesn't exist to do that.

There isn't a vast conspiracy to "oppress the masses" by using information just like cars aren't being made to run people over - it's just one possible and unfortunate thing that could happen.If your credit card reads as you having 10 drinks at a bar and then starting up your car 5 minutes later and then the GPS on your phone starts moving at 55mph on a 25mph street I'd say it's not a guise of stopping drunk drivers - it's an effective program.

Halo 1 was much much less complicated than any AAA title now. There are a lot of dynamic elements that are in action in games today that respond to player movement and perspective and Halo 1 did not have to deal with these things.Also, Halo 5 runs at 60fps which is twice as much as any previous title and this increase comes at a cost. How do subscriptions and DLC help Microsoft justify putting $800 worth of hardware into a $400 console that they are *already* selling at a loss? 343 thought they'd get the competitive gamers on board by giving them pretty graphics and a higher framerate but obviously chose wrong.They didn't just arbitrarily choose to not have split-screen, they made a shitty choice. Maybe if everyone had PCs in the living room that weren't bound by hardware limitations then we'd have it	gaming	1458792725
lol how am i wrong? most of the games that come out on console also come out on PC.. most of which have hardware lightyears ahead of what the Xbone has.

But why do you think they opted not to have split screen then, if not just by choice? The explanation I've seen is that they chose to have a higher frame rate rather than split screen because having both would exceed the ability of the Xbox One.

I have a really good 290 and you're definitely going to want to upgrade to use Freesync. Most things run ok at 100+ fps but things get a bit choppy with AAA games unless you start turning stuff down.I run Witcher 3 w/ everything on High/Ultra and its usually somewhere between 50-70 depending on how messy things are getting.

Good article! I think an explanation for Drum &amp; Bass's (basses?) success is that it had defined subgenres whereas dubstep didnt. Skrillex, Skream, Loefah, Borgore, and the kid who just pirated fruity loops and Massive all produced under the same genre title which quickly killed a lot of appeal.DnB on the other hand is way more compartmentalized which made it easier to find a niche you were into and just stay there without getting frustrated at declining quality or influence from outside sources. There are clearly defined lines between Jump Up, Neurofunk, Techstep, Liquid, nu-funk, etcMy only issue is with the dubstep beatport chart. While it does illustrate the point very nicely and visually it's not entirely accurate. The best places to buy dubstep are either directly from labels (bandcamp, etc), vinyl outlets, or juno download. Beatport is a pretty poor source for it so I don't whats there really represents the genre. 	dubstep	1461605915

Nah it definitely makes sense. It seems like basically overnight the whole genre blew up. I think a large part has to do with the internet becoming more accessible as a whole. DnB has been around since the early 90s, so most of the people making music there have been at it for a while. When dubstep started making waves it was easier to pick up a DAW and pirate some synths to try to hop on this "new latest thing" (thats what I did :P) and soon you get a massive amount of new producers uploading all their tracks under the same tag. I agree w/ Rusko &amp; Caspa since they had the midrange wobbles down that got everywhere. Then you had Borgore, 16bit, Datsik/Excision. I think once Skrillex came in thats when things went overboard since he already had industry connections and his music immediately hit a TON of outlets all once.Its an interesting subject for sure, especially when trying to figure out why this genre got so bogged down and others didnt have this problem (no sane person is going to argue that house/techno are "dead"). 	dubstep	1461627476
I'm just adding to the criticism of this thread (people selling out, etc). There's nothing wrong with experimentation. They are certainly entitled to do whatever the hell they feel like doing (just as I am to talk shit about it on the internet).From *my point of view*, as someone who listens to a lot of electronic music and saw it gain popularity, it just seemed a bit unauthentic that a bunch of artists suddenly turned around and started incorporating this style. Timbaland started claiming he invented dubstep. Paris Hilton had started DJing. Britney Spears had a single out that also had dubstep elements. Then in this environment Korn also released an entire album of collaborations/remixes in the vein of a genre that just got popular.So to me it seemed like a bunch of famous artists trying to jump onto a bandwagon that had taken off. To answer your last point, this entire thread is about discussing which artists have sold out. Whether you think that's bad or not is up to you, but this is why I think Path of Totality is a fair addition. 	AskReddit	1461628846

To be fair, the only times I've seen that (on this site) is when there's an article about South America or Russia and someone tries to complain about the US.Don't get me wrong, the US has a lot of problems, but holy shit it is nothing compared to what goes on in other countries.

I'm still kinda mind boggled how dubstep seems to have the most BS drama out of any genre that I follow. Maybe it's all this "positive vibes" type of BS thats preventing people from hashing out their issues instead of taking it to social media.The whole "producer didn't get paid" story is unfortunately just a fact of life. There's no money in music and labels barely make enough to cover overhead. Like Tunnidge said, the truth is somewhere in the middle.To be honest, you should be buying music because YOU want to have it, otherwise you're basically throwing money into a void of bureaucracy and the label/distributor. Artists themselves don't make much from items sold, if anything at all, unless they've magically found a label that conducts itself well from a business perspective or are selling their  music themselves.	realdubstep	1463683810

No you're not, you are actively hurting the system yes, but nobody is going to be hurt as a result of you not paying the $2 or whatever for parking.Even in OPs example, nobody is being harmed by him not paying the gym membership.

the seats are ALREADY empty. HIm moving up isn't going to cause everyone above him to think "wow we can move up too fuck the system"	AskReddit	1464829972
Him not paying the fee isn't going to cause that much damage. 1 spot out of 1800 is nothing. You are assuming this is a more widespread problem. And like he said, the parking people don't even check his block. If they were so concerned then they would. $2 a day is absolutely nothing compared to the revenue generated by everyone else. It's like shoplifting from wal-mart - it happens all the time. Yes you're not a great person for stealing but if you get away with it it's basically a victimless crime. I'm not saying they deserve it, nor am i encouraging the activity. I'm stating that it's very much not a big deal like that one guy crying about the state of humanity just because some dude figured out how to save money on parking. 	AskReddit	1464834631
That's not a good analogy. Wal-Mart is not somebodys home. Everyone there gets paid to be there and to do a job. Those people do not own the merchandise within, nor are they in any way affected by theft (since it occurs on such a tiny scale compared to the millions of items the store sells every day). Now you could argue that you are hurting GE by taking one of their lightbulbs and not paying, but that is a weak argument.Operations like football stadiums, wal-mart, and parking meters operate on a very large scale. Football stadiums take in hundreds of thousands of dollars every game. My point is that if even 5% people take advantage of the lack of ovesight in the system the world will not fall apart. Not paying for your parking is not the same as directly stealing from someone. 	AskReddit	1464838587
Alright man I can see we have a disagreement here.For the record, I agree with you. He *shouldn't* do any of these things. But parking for free just because the parking person can't be assed to check the block, or not paying for your gym membership because the front desk person doesn't check are not examples of the "downfall of humanity" like one poster was suggesting.That's all I was trying to say. One time one of my friends stole a pack of gum from a store (we were like 16). I thought he was a dick for doing this but you know, we're still doing ok and haven't moved on to larger theft.So just because some guys decide to move up a few seats at a sporting event does not mean everyone else is suddenly going to stop buying tickets. He SHOULDN'T do that, but you know if he does the rest of us shouldn't lose sleep over it. Like, you definitely should not steal music. But if you go pirate a single, we'll probably survive as a species. 	AskReddit	1464847515
you're totally right, i completely glossed over his point. my error.I also wasn't being very clear. I don't advocate any of these things. I think crime should always be discouraged. I was just disagreeing with one poster who was making a larger point of all these events like "oh not paying for parking is a sign that people are just out for themselves"I think he SHOULD pay for parking, I just don't think it's a sign of "the nature of man" or anything. it should definitely be discouraged, but I don't think it's overall that heinous of a crime.

Like he said, if you're going to get it anyway - why not? I preordered GTA:V because I was going to get it no matter what. The bonuses were nice too. Same with Overwatch. I had the money, might as well get the extra skin and buy it now. 	gaming	1465493866
well to be fair overwatch had an open beta so it was easy to see what was going to happen. With games like GTA it's pretty apparent what they're going to be like so it's a fair bet that it won't completely suck. On PC there's a bigger incentive not to preorder since sometimes optimization is utter garbage but if its a reputable developer (CD projekt red, blizzard, etc) it's not unsafe either.As far as your comment on debt, if someone's struggling financially they shouldn't be spending that much money on gaming regardless of if it's before or after release. For the most part I agree with you I'm just pointing out that there are some exceptions that make preordering justifiable 	gaming	1465495578

It makes sense because nobody ever has an encounter with a cop on a good day.

Thats not totally true.  People can promote they just can't spam into every single loosely relevant subreddit. Of course more established people are popular -  they have a wider audience already. 	self	1466376675
I've seen lots of original content from comic artists in /r/comics, although I do believe most of it is rehosted on imgur like you said. That just makes it easier to digest anyway though, since many sites don't do the image preview thing.My experience is with electronic music communities where I have never seen any of these problems. The only time something gets removed is if its obviously being spammed out by a new account. There's a line between organic content sharing and creating a new account that only promotes yourself to every loosely relevant subreddit. Maybe you are right in regards to the examples you listed, but in my experience reddit hasn't been that bad to content creators	self	1466378671
global warming is getting pretty serious 	wallpaper	1466401794
I moderate r/dubstep and our general policy is that you can link to your own site so long as you are a contributing member of the community. If 100% of your account activity is only submissions to your own stuff then we generally ban/spamlist those people. The site shouldn't be used as another stop on your marketing run. I don't think the system exists to stifle indie content creators, I believe this is just a byproduct of them being less popular and often using annoying methods to promote themselves. As a producer myself, I know it's tempting to just spam my shit at every platform, and I believe many people do which is why we have these rules. 	self	1466406545

You need more variation and swing on the drums. It feels like its just 4 minutes of Kick - snare - kick - snare. You gotta add some breaks n swing to things. Same for the hats. Also more modulation on the midbass, it starts to sound kind of stale after a while. Did you synthesize or use samples? If synthesize - more processing is always good, especially if you frequency split. If not - stop using samples. 	dubstep	1466457474
I think it can be hard to separate yourself from representing a larger group. Like in your example, if you were actually talking to a bear, the bear would at some level feel some need to quickly establish that "Hey not all bears are like that!

you look for other music.Seriously, expecting to get an ID for every track is ridiculous. So many artists have dubs and/or unreleased tracks that even asking in the first place is a fruitless and pointless endeavor. There are millions of tracks out there. Go find some other ones. There's about a 5% chance that someone can identify a track if google/shazam or whatever can't do it.

You just asked what to do if its always ID - ID. If the DJ isnt releasing the name of it, and it's a new mix, what do you think the chances of someone in this sub knowing what it is? Dubstep, and most other electronic dance music producers make music for DJs first - meaning they get the tracks as soon as theyre done, even if they never get released. Listeners come second. I'm sorry but that's just how it is - that's why every track is in 4/4 and drops at :55 seconds. Like I said, there's a 5% chance someone will find it. There are 4-5 threads every day with a shitty recording and "ID this 30 second snippet". I'm not saying you CANT. I'm saying you're better off just going 'yea thats a sick track' and either digging through the artists affiliated producers, record labels, or just using information you already have to find other music. 	dubstep	1466616303

That's not the point. I never mentioned personality. Also, I can have an interesting conversation about Murakami because I have no idea what that is. Hello person, what is murakami? Tell me how you stumbled upon this obscure thing that i have no idea about and why you like it so much.Slightly different than "well there are 50 trailers per day for Avengers and I saw it and now I have a captain america t shirt". The entry barrier is very low here. You have to actively seek out the two things you mentioned (except Moon, that one is pretty popular, but replace it with another obscure movie).Look at it this way, it's easier to discover that you like Katy Perry than some obscure band, because katy perry is on the radio all the time, while the other isnt.	AskReddit	1466807332
It still means you've put more effort into finding that thing. Like I said in another comment - it's "Basic" to like Katy Perry because she's on the radio all the time. You don't really have to put any effort into finding her since she's everywhere anyways.On the other hand, finding an obscure hip-hop artist (or whatever) is less "basic" because there's somewhat of a journey involved that had to take you there.I agree, it doesn't mean you're a special genius snowflake for it, but it's at least somewhat unique and interesting. 	AskReddit	1466809257
Sure, but it looks that way on the outside.Hey, all those girls in sororities, drinking starbucks, etc could have totally valid, great reasons for doing so.

I believe so, I mean by definition liking some obscure media IS more unique than something mainstream. I do want to clarify that I am not condemning the quality of the material. I don't think bad of the Avengers or whatever. I also agree with you that people can have unique perspectives about those things.But this isn't visible to the public. I said on another post&gt; Hey, all those girls in sororities, drinking starbucks, etc could have totally valid, interesting reasons for doing so.

I've got tons of backstory to that and I certainly think it's not because those things are popular - but I won't deny it looks pretty damn basic to the outside.It's completely superficial, although that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong. Hell I know loads of people who love the Avengers simply because it's -there- and popular right now. But I can't possibly argue that there aren't diehard Marvel fans who are just happy their favorite thing is popular right now. Maybe uggs are super comfy, I have no idea.

Look man, most people in this thread have ubiquitously agreed what 'basic' means. The existence of the phrase "basic bitch" means there's already a societal definition for it. It's not my just my judgments.You can follow the mainstream for whatever reason you want. I never called anyone a sheep and I most certainly never said anything about evil corporate lizard men. In fact, you'll see I always followed my statements with "doesn't mean it's a bad thing in any sense".[But i'll let urban dictionary explain it better](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=basic%20bitch&amp;defid=7739113)Also, all the examples you listed, are not the best. "Easily available" maybe, but northface jackets are only priced the way they are because of the brand, and starbucks is most definitely not the best coffee by any stretch of the imagination. You can enjoy them because they're available, but don't kid me and say you've tried all the brands and decided that one was the best.	AskReddit	1466811739

She believers herself to be unique, fly, amazing, and a complete catch, when really she is boring, painfully normal, and par.

To be fair, it's mostly people with decent AMD cards that are upset. We were hoping to a marginal increase in performance at least but it ended up being basically the same as the 290/390. I wouldve been ok with upgrading to it for the lower power consumption and maybe a small increase in speed but it's basically exactly the same. 	pcmasterrace	1467230582
It doesn't say the same performance though. I agree that their wording is obviously misleading but it says "VR CAPABILITY common in $500 GPUs"Technically not wrong 	pcmasterrace	1467232482

I just make a loop then beatmatch/phasematch and slowly mix it in. Dubstep lends itself to a lot of hard cuts so doing stuff like double dropping works really well (playing 2 breakdowns n then cutting into the new track)It's not really much different than mixing house, other than that it's harder to do long blends 	dubstep	1468380041
I think it depends. If it sounds good as a track then I don't mind. I'll find a way to make it work, because as a DJ it's my job to mix the tracks, not the producers job to make tracks that will mix if that makes sense.A lot of shit by oxossi, saule, hebbe, n the like is pretty abstract with a lot of swing but that's not a problem when it works in the track 	dubstep	1468381631
I don't see how you got there. Just because there's less incentive to fuck over your workers doesn't mean there won't be incentive to be productive or no accountability.The polar extreme of what you said would be, how is there innovation when closing down a branch to save money while giving yourself a bonus is easier than actually making a good product?Communism is more about having an empowered and sustainable workforce than "sharing everything". You can still be the owner of a business, you just can't form a mega-corporation. 	AskReddit	1468441531
I haven't studied it at a length further than reading communist manifesto and various internet articles, but the main aspect is mostly removing the bourgeoisie - the ruling class. It's ok with small businesses, private ventures, local bureacracies, but it really hates anything overarching like joint corporations, international trade agreements, and basically everything happening in Wall Street.As I understand it, the state does own everything but you're free to  innovate as you see fit - so long as everything goes back into the system. For example, right now I work at a company that provides healthcare, food, transportation, fixes your car, gives haircuts (some of these cost money, but the point is that it provides these) and the charge of admission is your employment. Imagine that but on a larger scale (which is also why it can't work in the US - it's just too big).Communist Manifesto was written for the generation of factory workers that were exploited by rich oligarchs who would cut corners wherever they could to make a profit. Communism wants to level the playing field by taking their profits and investing them back into the infrastructure of the country as well as bettering peoples lives That is, in theory anyway :P 	AskReddit	1468446122

i dont know why you're assuming that just because financing is available people are going to be irresponsible. It's not hard to budget if you have a consistent paycheck, and you can use financing to leverage yourself into a position where you have nice shit and can still pay for it. 	Amd	1468615769
I still don't understand. People finance shit all the time. Nobody can actually afford to drop cash on a car or a house.Let's say I got $500 of disposable income a month that I can do anything I want with. I can either save it, or just finance a monitor that I know i'll pay off in 3 months anyway, plus have cash now to spend on games or whatever else.I think you're assuming that people are financing things they can't afford AT ALL and that they're being irresponsible. I'm providing a counterpoint.I financed some expensive speakers from Guitar Center. I paid them off in about 3 months and that was the end of the story and had money to spend on other things in the meantime. No harm. 	Amd	1468616255
alright fair i guess we just disagree. Like I said, if you can budget right - it's really not an issue. 0% interest for 12 months means you can basically pay $100 a month and forget about it. That's a really good deal. If you're paying the rest of your bills and are in good shape financially, why not 	Amd	1468616947

I don't think that's true at all. I produce dubstep and have never run into the problem OP has. You can be plenty original even within those restrictions. Stop using presets, stop using sample packs made for your genre. Take influences from other types of music. Make a drone inspired hypnotizing beat at 140. It's all possible. Instead of using a snare get a short clip of an arrow hitting a target then automate delay time on it. There are tons of techniques you can use to separate yourself from others without having to change the time signature and bpm 	edmproduction	1469822061
Yeah I think I see what you mean. But sometimes genre restrictions can be good since you have a reference point to jump off of. Obviously if youre approaching a track with the mindset of "ok i need a wobble bass cuz thats what people do then that's not a good approach, but having an idea of what people are making can be good for inspiration.Mb OP needs to stop trying so hard to make 'future house' and just do whatever comes naturally 	edmproduction	1469828031

Not saying that that kind of stuff doesn't happen, but I'm a mod of a a few subs and more often than not things get removed because of auto-mod or a similar anti-spam feature. Reddit gets hit with an INSANE amount of spam and sometimes when a story rises too fast auto-mod thinks it's due to spam and thus removes it until a mod can approve it again - nothing nefarious. Also Rule #9 is "no videos of physical abuse of animals" so maybe someone saw it and removed it because of that?	videos	1484789027

I think the problem is that you're mixing free speech with moderation.If I'm the moderator of a community, I get to decide what content is permitted. If you are being an asshole, free-speech is irrelevant - you have violated the rules of that community and you're removed.Reddit has rules, if the_donald violates them, it should be removed. There's no grander idealistic issue. If your platforms policy are - racism is not allowed, and you say something racist, you should be removed. 	blog	1485822843
That doesn't work. What are those reasons for banning T_D? It's an issue of moderation. If your policy is "no hate speech", you can remove hate-speech because it violates policy. Simple as that. There is no freedom of speech issue because it doesn't apply.	blog	1485823000

right you are, but sometimes that's enough to lower the temps significantly. I had an air cooled 1080ti (MSI Gaming X) and it'd hit ~65C with fans considerably high (maybe 80%). the Sc2 maybe touches 60C with fans at 50%. However I was able to swap the fans with Cougar Vortex's and i can barely hear it	buildapc	1503366848

What hybrid cards do is move the heat away from the card itself onto the exhaust. It doesn't actually run cooler insofar as just moves the heat somewhere else. You still need good case cooling and fans moving air through. In general they'll run cooler by 10c-15c but again it depends on your fans.I have the SC2 Hybrid and it never reaches 60C because i turn fans up when it gets close	nvidia	1503871705

dont bother with push/pull it wont make a difference. Put hybrid radiator on exhaust with either push or pull (doesnt matter). Make sure you have good air intake into case	nvidia	1503940980
Bought this a while ago to upgrade (or, satisfy serious gear acquisition syndrome urges) from a 4690k.Very happy with it but keep in mind these run HOT. I had to mess around with some BIOS settings to get it to reasonable range but you WILL need beefy cooling if you intend on overclocking at all 	buildapcsales	1504552859
i might have been one of those people, i ended up selling mine and getting a corsair h115i. I think part of the problem is that it's kinda difficult to install this unit so it ends up sitting a bit uneven on the cpu - leading to subpar performance. 	buildapcsales	1504553219

yea since youre on linux idk whats available to you. I set it in bios and when it needs more tweaking I use MSIs command center app for my motherboard. Honestly since its a hybrid GPU you are probably ok with just setting it at 60% (or whatever is tolerable) and leaving it alone.

thanks a lot for your comment, this actually helped me a lot. You are right - Lexus is Lexus for a reason, and the GS350 will probably age gracefully and I still remember thinking 'holy shit' when i pressed down on the accelerator, vs the 'hey at least its not a boat' of the Genesis.Does your Lexus infotainment do well with USB drives? In my current car I usually just put a bunch of tracks on a usb, plug it in, and just hit play, so the mouse-controller might not even be a problem. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1516590009
thanks man, I think you've sold me! Use my phone for navigation anyways so will probably just leave the info on whatever and use the buttons. When I drove the two, the lexus was undoubtedly the better driver, and thats what is important!	whatcarshouldIbuy	1516600651
yea right? I just cant figure out what it could be! Everything is plugged in right, and I didnt have any issues for the past 6 months (since i got the PSU) until I applied all the latest Intel Spectre updates.

bizarre. Mobo is ASUS Maximus IX code, these are my boot settings - https://i.imgur.com/wtYQt0B.jpgIt's honestly JUST the BIOS. Windows itself just flashes my login screen then starts up just fine.

yea i'm lost as well. Changing those settings has had a mostly minimal impact... Windows is saying my Last BIOS time was 17 seconds. BIOS is latest, latest nvme drivers as well as drivers on everything else (I believe, got everything from ASUS' website)So PC starts up, black screen for a second, then ASUS BIOS screen for 3 seconds, then Windows logon and desktop.

Thank you for the detailed response + screenshots!I'll give this a shot and see if it works. LFTP does append while it's transferring. So Sonarr will see if the file is downloaded, and will know to move it from my local download directory into local /TV/?	seedboxes	1524723579
I have LFTP do segmented downloading so it combines everything into 1 file at the end that's completed. My seedbox completes the download, moves it to a folder, then LFTP moves it from there back to my NAS into a common folder. My issue was that it would move everything I'd download into the common folder and I needed Sonarr to differentiate what's TV and what isn'tI'll see if it works tomorrow, unfortunately the torrent site I use only allows RSS via Sonarr. I have this entered - https://i.imgur.com/4Ni6rms.pngAppreciate the help!	seedboxes	1524726288
So what folder does Sonarr import from? I'm trying to figure out how you get it to import since so far all I've accomplished is just get it to download and tag/rename	seedboxes	1524810931
unfortunately no, sonarr didn't move the files from my NAS folder into my other NAS folder. Not a huge issue though 	seedboxes	1524876830
Says Access to path is denied, which is odd since i gave it read/write access to the directories. I will try to adjust permissions. It did finally make the appropriate folder though	seedboxes	1524883688
does it help to enable Set Permissions under Permissions in Sonarr?	seedboxes	1524883871
as is traditional with these sorts of things, im not sure what I did but it seems to be working with Manual Import at least. Thanks!	seedboxes	1524884182
They are not, food service are contractors at facebook. source - work there as a vendor. 	bayarea	1524945038
Yea this is likely skewed too since there are probably some fiber-network engineers clearing 400K. A facebook full time employee generally makes upwards of 80K anyway so 200K is totally a fair figure.What sucks is there are loads of us who work as vendors and contractors but barely make 60K :( 	bayarea	1524945151

While that's true but IF you want dedicated media keys and RGB lighting with profiles there isn't anything better. Plus you can get PBT keycaps for Corsair boards anyway.I mean you said it right there, "You will not have RGB but". If someones buying a Corsair/Logitech board and doesn't care about their software and RGB then yes that's a waste of money but otherwise there isn't an equivalent. 	pcmasterrace	1525034591
the shine 6? I only see volume buttons on it and its $160. Plus the volume rolly bar on the corsair is neat, and being able to download profiles and link them to .exe'sI understand your argument but I don't think corsair is THAT much worse than the competitors, especially if you like the specific things it has that others dont. 	pcmasterrace	1525036073
Man here's the problem - you're describing things YOU want in a keyboard. I'm telling you why I got the one I did. I wanted dedicated media keys because I use them all the time. Plus I have RGB profiles for the games that I play and programs that I use because that's something I wanted. I forget where I got them, but you can definitely get 'real' PBT doubleshots for a K70. Anyway my point is that there are use cases that make Corsair a good choice and just because /r/mk has a certain way of doing things doesn't mean it's going to work for everyone. I've had it for 2 years and it hasn't disintegrated into dust yet either	pcmasterrace	1525036863
Ok but it's something -i want-. And if I'm spending &gt;$100 on a keyboard it better have things like a '$1 rolly bar'. I'm not seeing which Drevo has it, can you link me one?I got nicer keycaps for my K70, set up like 10 profiles for games and apps that I use and I've liked it for the past 2 years that I've had it. 	pcmasterrace	1525037131

How would I configure this to only do the latter steps?

I'm gonna offer a dissenting opinion in that I did not like the game. It felt repetitive in that you dive, get materials, craft some stuff, dive, look for materials some more, craft a thing, etc etc. I know the whole game mechanic is that you're diving (duh) but it just became tedious to have to constantly resurface. One day I hope amass the patience to go back and try again. 	GameDeals	1528408834

I highly doubt thats it. That's a serious stretch of a conspiracy theory.  You really think they're going to distract people from *actually playing the game*? We're all going to watch the same trailers and gameplay videos and make a conclusion for ourselves as to whether or not we want to buy it. I'm not sure if you've ever glanced at the "controversial" sorting option for comments, but I guarantee you there's a lot more toxic shit on reddit (and the rest of the internet) than you give it credit for. 	pcgaming	1529042761

I played it and it was a super disjointed game. There'd be moments of greatness - the worlds are compelling, it runs and looks fantastic, it's super fun to play, some quests are even interesting!Then the voice acting and the dialogue takes a dirt nap. You suddenly have 30 possible things you can do, none of which seem to have any impact on the story. You start mashing space to skip a novel of dialogue that gives you flashbacks to when you saw a part of Twilight on tv.It was totally worth the $5 for Origin Access.. but the variance in quality was jarring. 	pcgaming	1529172575

I fully agree.

OC'd 1080ti hybrid at &lt;50C and i cant even hear it	pcmasterrace	1529275077
100% worth it IMO. Never goes above 52C, super quiet, and doesnt heat the rest of my PC up since the radiator is an exhaust. I highly encourage either getting gentle typhoons or noctua fans though if they make a black version of these rad fans. When I had the ML120 on it i saw the temp slowly climb to 58C.Temps only matter because the card starts to downclock after 54C, so the better temp the better it runs. Mine does 2050mhz on the core at 52C but above that itll start to lower itself	pcmasterrace	1529277667

Personally I upgraded from a 4690k to a 7700k and it was 100% worth it. Right now there's probably not too much of a price difference between 7th and 8th gen so that'd youd be better off just going for an 8700k but if you can get a good deal you honestly would not be missing that much.Unless you already know what you need more cores for, it won't be a huuuge difference. My 7700k can reliably play any game, overclocked to 5ghz easily, and has no problems with the audio production stuff I do. If you're saving $150 total, not worth it. If its $250+ (including mobo +cpu), you won't be missing out on that much. 	buildapc	1531508118

I can see the side of being falsely accused and the review diminishes your ability to get more guests. So you ask Air BnB to remove the review as it is false and impacting your business (and thus their business)Not saying that's what happened or its right, but it seems logical 	technology	1531511078
I don't have a solution. Just saying there MIGHT be cases where it's not nefarious. I suppose if 3/4 people complain about theft AirBnB will have enough evidence to take action against the host. If it's 1/100 perhaps it's more likely it was just that 1 person who is wrong. 	technology	1531512826
i never said it should. But that's how it is. How is he gonna prove the host stole his money if 100 other people never had a problem?It sucks for OP but honestly, none of us know what "really" happened. He could've just lost the money. Host really could have stolen it from him! But if that review goes up, host gets mad that nobody wants to stay anymore, complains to Air BnB. Air BnB also loses money over it. Fuck it, they say, 100 other people left good reviews, this guy is probably full of it anyway. Review staying up and host losing business = definitely bad, review going down since there's no proof anyway = potentially ok. One time working at a hotel I was accused of going through someones luggage to steal an envelope full of money. Of course i didnt do that, wtf is the off chance there'd be money in the envelope? The hotel refunded the guests anyway because they want them coming back, even though they were clearly full of it, but how are you gonna prove that?AirBnB is the opposite. They don't need more guests, they need more hosts. In the article though they are 100% in the wrong, but in this case im not so sure. 	technology	1531518283

 If you can find one for around ~20K you could totally swing it. I think that's doable and they're known to be fairly reliable. If your job is secure and you can afford the $400 a month (or whatever it comes out to for a 5 year loan) that's not unreasonable. People are talking about buying a house but comeon, i'm 27 and that's not even in the picture (although i live in california so buying a house is a pipe dream anyway). Plus 75K is a ton of money if you aren't paying rent. Get it used, negotiate lower, check out it a mechanic and have fun. Life is short.

I dunno about that. Facebook makes it easy to plan events, coordinate groups of people, keep up with birthdays and collaborate with people in groups. I use messenger constantly and I really like groups for talking with other people in my industry/hobbies.Plus being able to donate to charities is nifty and generally a good cause.I know both google and FB have their drawbacks but I think its a bit silly to say its totally useless. If it is not for you then don't use it but it's clearly useful enough to the rest of their users. 	technology	1533003196
Does it still look good though? I'm of the mindset that you're not gonna max every game out with current hardware - that's just not the point of it. If it looks great at 80fps and 1440p just call it a win.	pcgaming	1533052636

I mean of course, but it's good to get an idea of what most people are reporting problems to be.Granted you have to actually read the reviews. If common problems are "audio bad" "seats uncomfortable" and "drove 4,000 miles after recommended oil change and it died" you know you're probably good to go anyway.I like the Hyundai Genesis a lot but combined its common complaints are that small things are likely to fail over time which is a nice insight into long term ownership. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1533059981

That is absolutely not true. The occupy movement cared about a small subset of people making money hand over fist. "Lifted out of poverty" is complete bullshit if you even look at the shrinking middle class or amount of people in debt. Jeff Bezos has 150 billion dollars but workers in his shipping centers live in their cars.The fact that education here brings most people in tens of thousands of dollars into debt is ridiculous. Most americans are 1 emergency away from bankruptcy.

You're not wrong for having preferences but it just seems you don't really understand why DJs are around. It's been this way since.. forever. If you like live performance that's great and you should go see those acts but faulting people for not performing live just seems to miss the mark of how people produce and why DJ's mix those tracks.	edmproduction	1533530785
No because producing and performing are two totally different things. DJing is about playing a cohesive set that spans an hour+ from tracks you've found. Actually digging and finding good tracks that most people haven't heard isn't "easy". Saying its easier to DJ than to produce is like saying its easy to make a synthesizer make sound cuz you just turn it on. 	edmproduction	1533530885
so? that doesn't somehow undermine DJing in contrast to live performance. They're two different things. I've passed on some of my favorite artists doing live performances vs DJing because the end result is a totally different experience.My point is that complaining about "less DJs and more performers"  shortsighted, it'd be like complaining about sampling in hip-hop vs people making beats from scratch. 	edmproduction	1533574837

$2K is too high, I sold my 03 escape for that much w/ 180K miles. IMO that's at about the point where enough other things will start going wrong too and its not worth it.

The dialogue is terrible and the animations are... strange but the gameplay itself is really fun. I got Origin Access for this and it was totally worth the $30/year. I beat the entire game and altho I skipped a lot of the dialogue it looks great, plays well, and actually has some highlights where it's not trash.If you just wanna be in the mass effect world for a bit, I recommend it.

Personally I'd be worried - 36K in 1 (maybe 1.5) years is a lot of miles. But if you really trust your mechanic then hopefully any issues will be apparent. Surely single-owner Mazda 3s aren't too much more? I've seen 2017 Mazda 6 Tourings for like $18K (non-rental)	whatcarshouldIbuy	1534709281

nah thats perfect actually, i was looking at the 6. I'm tall as fuck so I doubt i could fit into the 3 comfortably anyway.

I personally like the Infiniti/Lexus a LOT. Drove an Acura and idk something about it just didn't impress me personally, plus the infotainment is a bit of a mess. If you like Infiniti you could go for a Q40 as well. Very similar to Q50 in terms of power/size just less touchscreens since its basically a G37. I think those come with AWD.It's a tough call between those but I would take the Lexus, ESPECIALLY if you can get one with the mark levinson sound system. F-Sport trim doesn't add too much so don't bother since it'll increase the price a lot. Lexus has a stupid mouse-like controller but tbh it's not that bad just use your phone for nav instead. 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1535335433
Infiniti would be better for the money. I cant imagine what GS 350 would cost $15K and not have 100K+ miles on it, which might be reasonable for a 10 year old car but I wouldn't want to daily something that's been going for that long. As a headsup tho the G37 takes premium and the MPG is shit. Civic Si would be worlds cheaper to maintain. If that's not a problem the G37x is IMO the better car	whatcarshouldIbuy	1535335649
imo THE answer to this is Hyundai Genesis. 2015 is worlds better than before but you might have to wait cuz they're hovering around 22-25K	whatcarshouldIbuy	1535335868
Lexus is totally doable, even cheaper actually if you go back a few years. Also consider a Q40/G37 (same car). You can get 1 that's like &lt;$20K and has 30k miles. You can put 4-6K down and get a loan from a credit union with low APR. Honestly forget the youtube videos. No shit cars arent investments, that's not the point at all! You need em to get around and if youre gonna spend the money anyway don't get something you hate. If you've got a stable job you don't need to avoid payments either, its not like youre financing wayy over your head for 10 years or whatever. 5 year loan is perfectly acceptable if you have steady income. generally reddit hates any and all forms of debt but with proper budgeting and planning its not a big deal 	whatcarshouldIbuy	1535338059

you said&gt; nvidia has done a lot of work making sure the monitors they call gsync are qualityWhich i gave an example for not being true.

You don't even really need gsync above 100-120hz since tearing is minimal.

IMO those are the two best 'fun' sedans that are also reasonably reliable. How important is maintenance cost/MPG to you? G37 will be more expensive and fuel consumption is awful. Accord will be cheaper on both fronts.

Why is that a rational choice? Just because SOME western companies do it doesn't mean all of them are. There have been pretty good strides towards environmentalism (until recently anyway) across the board.OVERALL pollution in the US is better now than say, 1960. Hell we only stopped putting lead in gasoline not even that long ago. Point is we shouldn't be selling our trash because we should be better about not even having trash to export in the first place. 	worldnews	1542179043
&gt; My point was that the idea that western nations are really trying for decades to sort out their recycling programs (particularly the US)Ok thats still not true, there has obviously been progress towards sorting out recycling programs. Also if YOU might become complacent but there are obviously others who will try to make life more efficient and better. I don't even see how this is an argument. Of course poorer countries have less ability to have advanced recycling programs. Of course richer countries have more ability and momentum. If it was not the case why do we even have hybrid or electric cars? Why do we sort our recycling at all then? Also I'd argue it's not the rational choice, it's the choice to be exploitative and there's nothing rational about that. 	worldnews	1542246296

G37 is a bit tight on backseat room, GS350 is much better in that regard and is debatably more reliable although the two are both some of the most reliable cars around.

You're not wrong I just don't think this is a good example of that behavior. Calling someone a motherfucker is denouncing their character. "Shithole countries" and etc denounces entire groups of people and is incredibly discriminatory. I don't think either are necessarily appropriate to be said in a high office but I do not agree that the same sentiment applies. As for doing no wrong, then that will definitely be something we'll have to wait and see but at this time I don't see it as a red flag. 	PoliticalHumor	1546840410

I mean they charge to make money which in turn keeps their services operational (along with selling the hardware in the first place). It's not like the money is going directly into their CEO's pockets. 	pcgaming	1548989192
they dont, but steam doesnt have to sell you the hardware youre using either. IIRC most consoles are sold at a lossI just think saying 'its a lie!' is a bit hyperbole. 	pcgaming	1548990235
because if they are selling tons of consoles at a loss they have to make up for it in other areas. Since hardware is expensive to manufacture, ship, distribute, staff people to do all that, comply to regulations, market, put it in stores, etcPlus Sony/MS are massive companies with lots of moving gears, and I don't think most of us can claim to know if their online services are indirectly supporting another product elsewhere. That said I don't pay for it nor want to, I just don't think it's fair to say charging for online play is purely a 'we just want ur money' thing. Someone out there did a cost-benefit analysis and figured out this is what they needed to do to achieve success. 	pcgaming	1548993761

i'm pretty sure they're trying to pay him to do a review in general, even if its unfavorable. Their job is to get people talking about the game and offering incentive to review is easier than hoping enough people decide to do it on their own.

im inclined to be optimistic, but to be honest though I cant remember the last time I actually read a game review. There are so many sources out there to find out if something is any good that bribery seems ineffective (at least in my opinion, like you said, we wont truly know)Usually i look at gameplay, see what regular people on reddit have said, check price, and then decide.

then dont buy it?Idk what youre looking for here. Also those same 3 points were aimed at Steam back in the day. Doesn't matter who made the games, the end result is the same.Also most people just need the launcher to launch the game, I doubt most of the population cares about half the points you bring up. Fortnites success proves that. Your whole 'harms me as a consumer' bit doesnt even make sense. You have no rights here. If a company wants to release their game on one store for a year then another a year later that's entirely their choice. You're not being exploited or taken advantage of, you can just go spend money on another bunch of controlled pixels. This is like crying its unfair that Spiderman came out on the PS4 and not Xbox One. I am annoyed at installing another launcher but if the game is good, as I think Outer Worlds will be - then I'll buy it regardless. 	pcgaming	1553137444
&gt; Anti consumer they just want the money on a platform people don’t want and attempt to compete against Steam with less enough features that even piracy would be more beneficial at this point.If they didn't want it then they wouldn't have made that deal in the first place. It's obviously doing well enough that they're able to swing this to begin with. Saying it's better to pirate at this point is ridiculous. Also Battle.net has Destiny 2 and Black Ops (i think)	pcgaming	1553137600
The fact is - half this thread is people saying they're just gonna wait a year and buy the games then (if at all). So if you are all right and it's such a big issue then soon enough this will stop happening.So I wouldn't stress about it so much. Either things improve or you'll have to find another game to play out of the hundreds released every year 	pcgaming	1553138100

But that's not the case now. Each of those 6 launchers can launch tons of different games. Ubisoft has Uplay, EA has origin, etc. Back in the day you had to launch an .exe per game so I'd say this is an improvement regardless.I don't have a solution to your problem either, but I also agree with the rest of this thread that this is hardly the biggest issue. It won't even matter anyway. Redditors keep priding themselves on waiting for sales, meanwhile normal people are gonna buy these games for $60 on launch day and prove the point that it WORKS.

I was cross-shopping the '15 hyundai genesis, '18 mazda 6 signature, '15 Q50, and considering leasing a 335i.Q50 felt too small and while i liked the genesis a lot, I liked the lexus more and didn't need all the extra features the gen had. To me it just meant more things that could potentially cause problems down the line and my commute currently isn't long enough to make me need auto cruise control. Also this is kind of shallow, but every genesis in my area is driven by an old person and im like 28.Mazda 6 was actually great but it'd lose a ton of value and after test driving a 2016 i wasnt pleased with how much of it was rattling and seemingly falling apart. My lexus has nearly 50K miles and it feels like it came out yesterday. The promised reliability and resale, plus the little details like puddle lights, really swayed me in the end. Plus i found a dealer that was actually pleasant to work with - I ended up negotiating only over email and drove the car out within 45min of entering the place.	whatcarshouldIbuy	1556683806
thanks man!re: your questions - the interior is super nice. Everything is leather and is soft to the touch but still firm enough to feel solid if that makes sense. Engine is 3.5L V6 and 8 speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and manual mode if youre into that. Also has Eco, normal, sport and sport+ modes which adjust the throttle response and make the suspension + steering firmer. im a bad judge of interior though because my previous car had like.. 3 way adjustable seats and cloth so moving to something that has 2 lumbar supports and ventilated seats is such a massive upgrade I have no idea where it stands in terms of other luxury cars.	whatcarshouldIbuy	1556762059
people skim credit cards all the time, commit identity theft, and steal currency in digital form as well. That doesnt mean either is inherently unsafe, just the method of transfer and storage is. being decentralized is a feature of crypto - if its not for you that's fine, i too like banks for their features and service but that is not the point of cryptocurrency.	Futurology	1556763401
First off, a credit card functions completely differently. You are borrowing money and then paying it back. A better example would be using cash.What recourse do you have if someone stole your cash and you did not know who? Crypto is as secure as its endpoint - you. If you put cash into a bank, you are trusting that bank and currently banks are insured. If you put crypto into an exchange, you are trusting that exchange, which is not insured. If you put that USB drive or whatever into a safe it will be just as safe as if you had put cash in there, minus the fact that you can password protect the USB drive as well as the safe itself.	Futurology	1556773419
right, i should have clarified that. my point was that crypto isnt inherently unsafe just because of OPs post about a thief breaking into a house and stealing personal info. They could just as well steal credit cards and other payment instruments. I should have been clearer about that	Futurology	1556775212
crypto appeals to people like libertarians who already don't care for the systems or recourse you mentioned. they dont want to trust a bank in the first place, and to them local digital wallets are inherently better because they are 100% their own responsibility. you can disagree with that but it just comes down to a philosophical difference, and honestly cryptocurrency just isnt a mature enough format yet to really judge it on its downfalls yet, considering we probably wouldn't even be having this conversation 10 years ago. In another decade there may be easier ways to have both systems and the people who are comfortable hiding all their cash under their mattress can do just that	Futurology	1556775555

I used to run a ported 12" in a cab i built w/ a 500w alpine monoblock and it was great. Really depends on the type of car you have though - I would suggest a sealed 10" or 12" with at least 500w RMS in general.You don't want to go overboard with the sub because then you'll be chasing the rest of your system to match it and that becomes expensive real quick. don't buy kicker, pyle, or boss, they are absolute trash. Go to crutchfield.com and enter your info in there. Sundown audio, SSA, alpine, rocksford fosgate, and sound ordinance make good units. Also don't listen to people who'll tell you to get 1000W RMS setups - its completely overkill and itll sound like shit if you dont also pour money into the rest of your speakers.	realdubstep	1557702632
in that case since you have a small car I'd suggest a shallow 10", something  along [these](https://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-TS-SWX2502-Shallow-Mount-Pre-Loaded-Enclosure/dp/B00JQTU3QC/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_107_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=ZDQHZ7W0RQQ1MVTAVE0E) lines would probably work well, although I'd get a regular box.With subs the box is key so a bigger box would give you more bass but if space is an issue then I think this would be okEither way, any subwoofer will make a huge difference! Cannot recommend crutchfield enough either, they have a ton of guides as well if you want to install it yourself, which isn't that difficult - just takes a while.	realdubstep	1557703255
their amps are just cheap and not that great for durability, plus they always tout OOoO 2000Watts for $50 when in reality thats the PEAK figure and not RMS which is what actually matters. I highly recommend alpine as a 'mainstream' brand - i've had my MRV-M500 for nearly 7 years or so and it's never faltered, plus they test all their units and they usually end up more powerful than advertised (mine ended up hitting 560w RMS rather than the advertised 500!)That all said, its not like it'll blow up immediately, and high chance is you'll be just fine with it - but IMO its worth it to invest in durable electronic components especially when theres a lot of power involved and its attached to an expensive vehicle.	realdubstep	1557709415
+1 for installing yourself - it kind of a pain in the ass but you learn a lot about your car and will know exactly how to fix it if something breaks down the line.By pain in the ass i dont mean its hard, its just kinda tedious to have to run wires without it looking like shit	realdubstep	1557710265

Btw the correct answer is "yes, if we're going to create more kids, we need to create better resources for them".	AdviceAnimals	1558058468
youre the one who distilled it down to ''pay for my kid or ill murder it'' and i'm asking you to reflect on the circumstances surrounding that.A life in the womb barely exists in the real world. It has no autonomy  or preference. If a baby is born that means the parents obviously got it to that point. If you make the choice that the 'baby has to be born' while it doesn't even exist yet you are forcing that choice to people who may be ill-equipped to deal with it.	AdviceAnimals	1558059667
It absolutely doesn't matter what your thoughts are on the reason people have sex. They will have it no matter what. If you ban safe abortion, people will have unsafe abortions. I don't care how much you preach your abstinence-centric stance - it is wrong and it will always be wrong, otherwise we wouldn't even have this problem to begin with. You're trying to tell people to deny literally an evolutionary urge.This WAS a chance to get ahead of an issue and improve quality of life. Also 'punishing an unborn baby' is a misnomer. The baby doesn't exist yet. At *6 weeks* it's barely a bundle of cells, if you're a man you've probably collectively wanked out more than that - does that make you a murderer? Perhaps you should start taking more responsibility.	AdviceAnimals	1558059940
You have no idea what you're talking about. First off they didn't - https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000000591&amp;cycle=2016And secondly your shitty attitude of not wanting to help others is only contributing to the problems of the world.	AdviceAnimals	1558104485

how is it lazy hollywood? they're making movies for people who want to see them.

depending on price a 7700k is a totally reasonable upgrade from an i5. I'm OC'd to 5ghz and have absolutely no problems maxing games out.

he's not saying that at all. this is just how things are right now. you can talk about how artists SHOULD get paid all you want, it wont change the reality of the situation. I love making music but I'm very conscious that I need to keep my day job. &gt; But modern technology has left the choice of payment for free digital goods up to the consumer. They will support products at their discretion and leave the rest behind.This exactly, you are not going to get people to give up spotify and go back to paying $20 an album. if you want art to be a career you need to adapt.	toptalent	1561005146

im just saying i think a vast majority of artists right now are people who casually make art and theres a ton of such people. I'm not saying they shouldnt but I think its not unrealistic to say that its hard to find a career as an artist. Place yourself in like.. ohio or something and it becomes a different story than LA. As for the original comment, i produce music and its pretty much accepted that only a tiny percentage of people are making money on it, thanks to technology its easy to access and easy to create so I'm not surprised and I dont think anyone should expect to make a living from it.	toptalent	1561006790

/u/SireBelch solved it!&gt; Since you’ve already tried calling the toll free Enform help number, try this instead… Get in your car, and press the SOS button that’s over your head near the sunroof controls. Normally that calls the emergency call center, but since your car isn’t enrolled in that, you’ll be directed to a customer service system instead. They tend to have a little more juice than the phone people have. Let them know the trouble you’re having and see if they can help. They have access to systems that we don’t have here at the dealership level. If it asks you why you’re calling, say “enrollment”. Then when the person comes on, tell them you haven’t been able to add your car to your account on Lexus Drivers. They might try to sell you some services, but you can always decline. They should help regardless even if you don’t buy any services (safety connect or destination assist).This worked for me! Took about 4-5 minutes	Lexus	1561254677

the issue isnt installing but getting the SD Card itself. You can get used ones on ebay but acquiring updated maps is an issue. There used to be a forum called gpsunderground that provided them but unfortunately it's shut down recently.	Lexus	1563224329
eh barely, 9900k can be oc'd to 5ghz and then its top of every benchmark. Besides 3900x and 9900k cost the same	buildapc	1563224548
whats your budget? ALso what DAW are you using? Ableton kind of sucks with multicore loads so single-core is all that really matters, and in that case just buy the best i7 you can afford.If youre using FL Studio go ryzen since its better at that. I have a 7700k overclocked to 5ghz and run ableton with no issues	buildapc	1563224698
I don't think they are, in  all benchmarks I checked an OCd 9900K performs far above it. Itd be great to have the extra cores but the speed just isnt there yet and I dont do anything that would take advantage of all 12 anyway.	buildapc	1563231163
I'll look more into them, I have an ASUS now and I like it but theyre wayy too expensive	buildapc	1563231179
I'm looking to get the best CPU i possibly can and 11% is 11%. It's at the top of every [benchmark I saw here](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/amd-ryzen-9-3900x-and-ryzen-7-3700x-benchmarks-why-amd-beats-intel)If something happens in the next 2 months or so and the 3900x soars then I'd consider that, but for now I think an OC'd 9900k is the best move for me.	buildapc	1563231790
yea i have one now and i really like it, but theyre super expensive which is a bummer	buildapc	1563231813
You don't need to do anything, just update BIOS once in a while. My rule is don't fuck with it until something goes wrong, then you may have to hunt down the drivers to get things working again	buildapc	1563234281
i mean of course it wont, it has 4 less cores. If you plan only gaming with it, then yes its probably the best CPU you can get (before you go into insane HEDT type shit), cost aside.If cost matters, the 3700x is a vastly better choice. Personally, I'll probably get a 9900k due to the OC potential and sheer core speed.	buildapc	1563235195

that's pretty overpriced for a 2015, I got mine for $26.6K OTD(not counting downpayment, tradein, etc)At that point go for the 2016/17.	Lexus	1563831055
Everything in the middle, DSP OFF (it sounds terrible with surround enabled), Auto Leveler On, Fade slightly to the rear.I also added a 500w 12" sub into the trunk which complemented the Mark Levinson system very well. Also listen to a lot of bass heavy music (drum &amp; bass, dubstep)	Lexus	1563831139
Pretty low tbh, you'd need the mark levinson amp installed as well and that's expensive as hell. Not sure if the non-fsports come with a sub too, but my GS 350 had a small sub in the rear.	Lexus	1563831222
i dont get this at all, the i9 is clearly faster. If someone were to give you either CPU for no cost I'd choose the i9 every time. 8 cores at 5.0ghz is a fantastic offer. AMD does offer better performance for the price but if you just want the fastest CPU for gaming the 9900k is it, at least until games get better at multicore.	pcmasterrace	1563862678
I'm specifically talking about the i9 9900k here though, not a 9600k or 9700k. It overclocks great and is currently sitting at the top of every gaming benchmark. If you're shopping for $500 CPUs, who cares how the rest of the segment is performing? For that much your options are the 3900x or the 9900k and if you're focused on gaming or do things that don't scale very well w/ core count, the 9900k is just better at that. Idk why OP would choose a ryzen 7 over that. When I upgrade i want to get whatever is the best cpu out there and unless something drastic happens, right now that's a 9900k. If by some magic games suddenly do start actually scaling by '30%' with more cores, then yea a 3900x would make sense, but that's not happening right now.	pcmasterrace	1563928349
Gameplay is very fun but everything between it (traveling, cutscenes) is rather tedious. Depends how much you value $30 really, I'd say at $15 its a definite buy, at $30 a maybe. I got roughly 18 hours out of it and it was fun enough to calm down my anticipation for Doom Eternal.	GameDeals	1563929397
Userbenchmark has always been a waste of time, Im confused why this surprises anyone. It's only ever been good for comparing your components against the average of the same components to see if anything isn't working as it should.Use real benchmarks for research.	buildapc	1564010097
only use userbenchmark to compare your build against the averages, not for comparing CPUs. For that use tomshardware, or gamers nexus	buildapc	1564010204
as a warning though, this might break some things. I had to reinstall the store to get the xbox app back (I subscribed to the xbox pc game pass)I had some other issues that eventually lead to me rolling back the changes. I see it has fields to leave most trouble-causing items alone, but wanted to raise caution in case someone rushes ahead to uninstall everything MS related.	hardware	1564011035

will this actually make a difference in gaming? I'm looking to get maybe get a 3900x in the coming months and cant figure out whether to keep my current ram (3200mhz, Cl16) or get something like this.	buildapcsales	1564103909
yea i have 32gb but I haven't kept up with RAM at all so was wondering if something happened to make the difference worth it (especially in this thread with people talking about CL14 vs 16, etc)	buildapcsales	1564105273

fyi it doesnt 'really' eat tires but you cant rotate them so if you drive very aggressively you'll feel it.

I'm happy AMD is doing well since it means 9900k's might drop in price and they make more sense for my use case than 3900x. The brigading is ridiculous though, like a gigantic corporation producing CPUs needs online defense against another gigantic corporation. Getting this invested into who makes your computer parts is ridiculous	pcmasterrace	1564447038
Performance is hit/miss, felt really stuttery on my system (1080ti/7700k)Abilities are fun but the plot is fairly generic, but I actually liked how they incorporated the TV show episodes into it. As someone else mentioned, I feel like another iteration of this type of game might be a hit.	GameDeals	1564447358
i think the FPS minimum is going to rise naturally. A few years ago it'd be unheard of to get above 30 fps on a console, now there are units dedicated to that and its probably going to be a selling point for future consoles.	pcgaming	1564450965
I don't need a cooler (have a noctua d15), and I want to overclock to 5ghz, plus if I was budget conscious I wouldn't be shopping for a $500 cpu to begin with.In every benchmark I've seen other than synthetic its ahead by noticeable amount. No application I use scales to use 12 cores and rather most would benefit from the higher clockspeed (games, audio production (mostly games)). I'm not sure why I'd get a 3700x either, like I said I'm only interested in upgrading to whatever the flagship is so either the 3900x or 9900k. Also if the cpu was a black box the 9900k would still be ahead (even if by a small margin)I don't understand why this is such a point of contention. I don't want a cpu that's slower and cheaper, and for the 12core  if you're saying at other points the performance is the same then why does it matter at all?	pcmasterrace	1564498334

the point isnt to start shit but to get an idea of a benchmark for compensation. If you're looking for a reasonable increase in salary and have that knowledge it lets you ask for something that's fair rather than just throwing a random number out.It's not necessarily discrimination either, sometimes experience, education, time of entry, etc all play a role in compensation so you have to take that into account as well.

this is the dumbest thing ive read. You'd think my 7700k is useless for more than one task at a time if you went off comments like this - I can easily play civ 6, watch netflix and browse reddit at the same time.Just because AMD has more cores doesn't suddenly give it near godlike computing power.	pcmasterrace	1564709584

i dont think bringing up a raise in a promotion review is 'stirring shit', my company has regular reviews every 6 months and people are ranked by performance - managers advocate for their teams because if the whole team is happy and does well then everyone gets more money and better bonuses. The whole team also writes manager reviews and that goes to their manager and so on so if something fucky is happening then nobody ends up happy. If the company is the type that wants to undercut everyone then yea there's not much you can do, but as always it depends on your work environment - if youre in a place hostile enough where management looks at discussing salary as a bad thing you're probably fucked to begin with.

I wanted a top of the line CPU and choose the 3900x over the 9900k and its definitely been more work than i expected.Works fine at 1.34v and 4300mhz on 12 cores though, but it took some work	Amd	1566543158
&gt; You can push overpriced, inferior performing products so long as people THINK they're good or better than the competition. overpriced sure but AMD still has nothing in the high end to compete. if you want the absolute fuck-off best hardware you're getting intel/nvidia	Amd	1566543273
i mean if its hitting 4.6ghz in that small of a window that doesn't even count. I monitored it with HWinfo/monitorMy hynix ram is running at CL20 3000mhz right now otherwise i cant POST :(	Amd	1566586806
i sure wish i read this analogy before buying a 3900x for... some reason	hardware	1566588843
I dont think youre unlucky, the CPU is a bit fucky right now is all.I manually set my voltage to 1.35 and all 12 cores to 4300mhz and its been stable. I wanted 4.5ghz but this is fine and is only like 2% behind a 9900k (non oc'd) in benchmarks for single core so ill take it.Keep in mind it DOES care about RAM too. So take a look at that as well.	Amd	1566589398
SMT turns off the other 6 cores correct? Is that the 'Simultaneous Multithreading' option in ryzen master?	Amd	1566589447
interesting - i definitely don't need all 24 (honestly feel like an idiot buying this CPU without having a good use case for it but o well)Ill give this a shot - thanks!	Amd	1566589690
SUPPOSEDLY those numbers don't mean anything and it's totally fine for it to hit 1.45v sometimes. But I have been having good performance with my config regardless	Amd	1566589748
yea thats the thing - i dont. I just wanted to get whichever flagship CPU was out (work bonus lowered threshold for rational thought) so I figured more cores would come in handy going forward. tbh the 3900x has been a headache because it wont play nicely with my RAM (cant POST with XMP enabled) but its performance is good enough to keep me from wanting to return it + go 9900k	hardware	1566593383
i have not - im not familiar enough with those to know what to do. My previous CPU was a 7700k which was easier to overclock/configure	hardware	1566593750
I gave this a shot and no go unfortunately. Won't POST with anything above 3000mhz. I tried 1.125 SoC, 1.4v for ram, nothing - still BSODs as soon as it clears BIOS. I ordered some 'AMD approved' RAM from newegg thats supposed to hit XMP timings (3600mhz, CL16-19-19-36 or something like that) so hopefully that helps.	hardware	1566596383

Here's the best thing to do - set everything up then ignore it. If you stress over every 100mhz or benchmark you will never be happy. In reality it absolutely does not matter. unless something is going horrifically wrong, just do whatever you got your CPU for.Seriously even in gaming its like a 5% difference against a 9900k. Even less at 1440p. Will you really care about like 56 fps vs 60fps? At this price range the CPUs are basically arbitrary	Amd	1567044444

yea i have a 280mm AIO + noctua fans, its not that bad but i ran a stress test at my 5.0 OC and it hit like 92C max which i wasn't super happy about.

I did the opposite, I returned a 3900x for a 9900k. I had a bunch of problem with the ryzen but tbh ultimately DAWs are not as good at multithreading as you think.

1.28v is pretty high, are you overclocking? I have a 280mm AIO w 2 noctua fans and running 1.24-1.25 @ 4.9ghz and it still gets toasty under a stress test (82C). Its an 8 core 14nm CPU so you need a big cooler if youre gonna run it over stock	buildapc	1567654004

I mean both of you are right. That's how they created a service that finally undercut taxis. It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. I agree that saying they contribute 'nothing' is ridiculous - being able to get across town for $10-15 is pretty awesome. Uber is a fantastic service in the same way iphones are fantastic devices. It's just the cost to getting to that point is steep and unethical at parts.	ABoringDystopia	1567737974
ok i can't though. our public transport is straight shit and to get across town would take me like 2+ hours and way more than $3.	ABoringDystopia	1567741780
I think you are actually - my city had shitty public transport long before uber existed. It's not going to get any better regardless of what uber does, that's been known before. If they suddenly went away tomorrow, I won't suddenly gain more than 1 rail line or a bus station 2 miles away.

saying its 'the same game' is pretty ridiculous when shit like Pokemon has been doing the same exact thing for a decade longer.

I said theyre fairly different amongst themselves, so no i don't think its fair to say that CoD is the same game released every year and don't think it's a good example of this problem at all. Especially when if you contrast them against other series. I don't see how that's flawed.	pcgaming	1569383149
i mean thats distilling it down so far you could say all FPS games are the same because you get a gun that reloads and shoot bullets at other characters. I wouldn't say all battlefield games 'are the same' just because the setting changes.They have new maps, new campaigns, an addition of new killstreak mechanics and game modes and I think that definitely counts. I played mw3, infinite warfare, black ops 3, and bit of the others here and there and while similar - i wouldn't say it's the same as something like madden where just the roster and graphics change. Like I said - my only point was that in comparison to some other series they aren't as copy+paste as people make them seem out to be.	pcgaming	1569391074

not buying 3 video games for $12 is one of the dumbest and pettiest ways to protest, and is utterly inconsequential in the grand scheme. really, this whole 'boycott blizzard' thing is basically a feel-good circlejerk.You want real change - buy actual tangible locally produced goods, vote in honest politicians, become informed about what you can do at your job to affect change, and change your diet to support it.	pcgaming	1570769751

that doesn't mean anything? that's just confirmation bias. what about the other times you've seen irrelevant ads?tell me whats more likely - you get shown ads based on your actual searches on their service - or they created an elaborate (and incredibly complex) system to somehow recognize all your words + transmit it to them using your phones mobile network without using up a deathly amount of battery and data?Why would the 2nd even make sense to do?	buildapcsales	1571850061
its not 'harvesting'. its data you've given them by using their service. just like facebook, they make money by offering third parties the ability to buy ads based on those parameters - they don't actually have access to your data as a person.	buildapcsales	1571850133
we know the NSA can listen to ACTIVE conversations, but that does not mean that Google themselves are.

again, what is more likely - you talk about a camaro so that means you like cars, youve searched cars before so google shows you ads for cars. You follow people on facebook and youtube who talk about cars, someone on your wifi searches for cars all the time. You subscribe to a car magazine, and have bought car supplies in the past.All these things are data points that someone can target to show you ads for a camarao. Why would they need you to talk about it?	buildapcsales	1571850492
yes they do, they save it to do analytics to improve the voice access. I have a google home and im fully aware that the cost of using it regularly is to improve that recognition. I don't have an issue with it since I consented to give it that data. I also think its harmless and there's honestly not much google can do with it - whatever data they get via voice ive already given to them via search and web-tracking. I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding on reddit about how these companies operate which is why im arguing in other threads about this. People yell 'they sell data' without truly understanding what that means. The bigger threat is smaller companies that have shitty security and continually get breached since they can't afford google/facebook level security engineering.	buildapcsales	1571871658

&gt; But it’s so stark the difference in support between Hong Kong and any of the dozens of other protests and liberatory movements going on. II don't think this is surprising though? Hong Kong is way more relevant to most americans because the protesters use social media very effectively - which is where most americans are going to see this. It's not necessarily that they don't care, its just more prevalent to begin with.That and im sorry but the middle east has been going through shit nearly nonstop - hong kong is way more similar to a US city than Baghdad (for instance) so the story strikes close to home. theres no need for criticism because someone knows about 1 crisis but another.

I think level design plays a huge part in that. Also I suspect the reviewers just beelined for objectives. I have 10 hours in the game and I'm not done (still havent been to the 4th planet). I kind of agree with the titanfall 2 point, its a way better deal for $10 (although my campaign experience was like 10 hours) Tbh a lot of content in games like Witcher isn't remarkable. After the 100th ? mark in Skellige I just started ignoring them. Same with Skyrim.	pcgaming	1574127211
&gt; On the other hand, popular portrayals of gang culture, especially in music, don't mention the downsides nearly as much. The increasing influence of inner court hands like the Crips, Bloods, and Latin Kings lines up with the increasing popularity of gangster rap.I don't agree with this, mostly because the films are equally clear about the downsides (boyz n the hood, even straight outta compton). The music itself varies widely depending on who is creating it though, so its hard to paint a picture of ALL rap music.	MurderedByWords	1574130867
&gt; Only people that don’t listen to rap can so ignorantly claim that “rap glorifies violence”.man thank you, it blows my mind that people can even say that.

my comment wasn't referring to you, i was speaking generally. but &gt;I wonder what would happen if these rappers would use their talent to bring kids up and use their voice constructively, how it might impact the future and ideas kids are having today. this is BS. I can't speak to it fully because I'm not part of that community but you don't solve deeply systemic issues by criticizing the victims. That's just victim blaming. Saying why don't rappers rap about more positive things and then maybe their environment would improve really diminishes the issue. Why not expand and tell Ke$ha to be more of a positive role model instead of singing about partying? Where's the backlash against pop musicAlso labels exist to promote music and artists, it is literally their job to 'cash in'. People clearly want to hear this music otherwise it wouldn't be popular.

while researching the 9900k i kept coming across an exchange similar to'but the 3700x is cheaper and only 5-10% slower''so its slower?''but its cheaper!''...why would I want to buy the slower CPU?'If you're cutting costs in your build, you wouldn't be looking at an i9 to begin with	pcmasterrace	1574633379
AMD definitely does, but if that $150 is that meaningful that person shouldn't have been looking at an i9 at all. It's a flagship product for enthusiasts, its not supposed to be (or going to be) cost effective. It's like an **80ti type card from Nvidia. I got it because i wanted whatever was the best CPU (for consumer purposes), and didn't need the 12 cores of a 3900x, which IMO is great but has more specific usecases	pcmasterrace	1574635395
I mean it really comes down to your level of disposable income. Like I said if you want the absolute best CPU + GPU those are the 9900k + 2080ti, esp if your build budget is more like 4K. If you're interested in saving money, you shouldn't be buying those. I'm not disagreeing that ryzen makes a better value proposition, but if price is no object the i9 is the one to get.	pcmasterrace	1574642290

if you dont do anything core dependent then 9900k &gt; 3900x (flagship CPUs). Idk what your budget is like though or there's an area you can move more money towards rather than CPU.But I was choosing between those two and went 9900k since I don't do anything that'd take advantage of 12 cores, but the 5ghz clock speed definitely is nice	pcgaming	1574711916

You can be an informed consumer without lashing out in every comments section, which is what that thread was. You talk about video game releases like they're personal betrayals... Also, the game isn't out yet so all of this talk is conjecture. If you weren't going to preorder it before, and aren't now - then it absolutely doesn't matter what they say about the game. MTX or not, until we're actually playing it and spending money on it i wouldnt worry	pcgaming	1574712658
I guess i should have said capacity. You're not gonna get huge gains over what they're already binned for. it won't overclock by 600mhz like a 7700k or 9900k do/did.	pcmasterrace	1574713282

yea I still think they largely boost automatically so there isn't too much point in tinkering around in BIOS. I had a 3900x briefly and at best it hit 4300mhz (barely stable). I ended up returning it for a variety of reasons, but one thing I do like about intel is the ability to descend into tweaking hell by trying to get 5ghz out of it (something im into)	pcmasterrace	1574718699

fair enough, makes sense	pcmasterrace	1574721456
sure but when this news initially breaks that's the most impact it will have on brand and product awareness. Obviously in this case it didn't pan out for Intel, but if a review is posted on reddit or FB and makes its rounds, that's the most attention its going to get.&gt; The people who go to read reviews on day one are a minority actually day one is the most important day, after that the tail end is barely comparable to the initial traffic.	pcgaming	1574737843

IIRC they said that about MCC in general didn't they? the other games may do better. Honestly it runs ok if you lock it to either 60 or 120. I tried running it at 144 and it was terrible but those 2 values seem to work.	pcgaming	1575844860

they should probably try to understand the problem first rather than 'they're selling my data'. That's not what happens. FB/Google sell ad space for targeting. The ad buyer doesn't know who you are. Actually most of their funds come from selling ad space, and most of the risk is from third-parties who ask for access to your FB/Google profiles then have shitty security. There's plenty to blame Google/Fb for but actually safekeeping your data is not one of them. Who do you think has better privacy security - a billion dollar corporation or some stray mobile app?	buildapcsales	1576003799

they dont 'give' your data to the government, thats not how it works. At best the companies do their own anti-terrorist investigations and report what they find to law enforcement, same with combing through data to find child pornography and other unsavory things. They're the ones *going* to the govt when it comes to reporting crime, as is their regulatory duty.Govt can ask for information if they have a warrant just like anything else. Source: actually worked with legal departments in these companies. Its way more regulated than you'd think. They do not get kickbacks	buildapcsales	1576008907
I can't speak for telecoms, but ive worked with google/facebook and they only escalate actual crime to the gov't. I don't have any reason to believe that the data collected by a google home mini would end up at the FBI unless there is already some kind of investigation into you, in which case it would just supplement an already existing case rather than be a surveillance tool on its own.	buildapcsales	1576012472
theres a pretty wide variety of gametypes, even pve like Firefight so you're always bound to find something you like.

they filter out blue light to help your eyes. I have a pair of glasses specifically for work b/c im staring at a screen most of the time, but yea $100 for non-prescription is ridiculous.	pcmasterrace	1576027099

the components you included are almost completely different than what the mac has. The mac pro is geared at companies with multi-million dollar hardware budgets who buy these to also have direct support line if anything goes astray, not to spent $40K on newegg, so i'm not sure what the point here is at all. this is like comparing an sedan to a tow truck and saying 'see, the tow truck is more expensive but they'll both get you from A to B!'	pcmasterrace	1576035703
idk what your point is here. Clearly "We're grown adults and can do whatever the fuck we want." doesn't work or we wouldn't have HR departments. My company doesn't care either *as long as theres preferential treatment* but I can totally understand why more strict, professional environments would rather just avoid the issue altogether for sake of keeping things even.	movies	1576047457

Thing is, at a higher difficulty a Civ AI will still do dumb shit it'll just do it at a much faster scale than you so it's easier to get overwhelmed.

a type of, sure. But barely 50 years ago did votings rights get extended to minority groups meaning affirmative action is not that significant when considering a history of oppression	unpopularopinion	1576228336
a game that's been out for over a year on other platforms, and a 20% discount amounts to $12 over sticker price - tbh what it should have come out at in the first place. Not pleasant or nice sure, but hardly illegal. Like I said when buying at launch you should just factor in full cost, if 20% is enough to not buy a game then it's probably not worth it.	pcgaming	1576228551

hardly 'hurt' but that's like.. how we live in society is to pay taxes (personally inconvenient) to benefit a greater good.  If you're in a position to be negatively impacted by affirmative action, you are generally already in a much better place to deal with that impact than someone who is being benefited by affirmative action and already has limited opportunities. Does it actually work in practice? maybe - it sure isn't perfect. But I understand why it exists and I think that's a good reason.	unpopularopinion	1576356271

I've heard that this doesn't always work so YMMV but for me, capping the FPS to 120 has worked perfectly - no stuttering or weird animations. It runs at a CONSTANT 120, which might be a factor.(9900k/1080ti)	pcgaming	1576891217

&gt; Tourism is 21% of Hawaii’s economy, and the tourists, while naive of the area, just go to have fun and have no plans of usurping or tainting culture. That IS usurping culture lol. Like all the resorts that set up shop, charge $1500 a night per room and hire locals to clean it isn't exploitation? At the very least its somewhat of a problem. Hawaii's history is very different from most states, it was literally annexed at gunpoint.	bestof	1578187755

&gt; What does it prevent them from doing? Tourists aren’t building telescopes. Sure, but it takes land from them. Native Hawaiians used to not believe in private property, in fact when individuals became able to own property the terms were very unfavorable to the natives which I bet started the feelings of resentment. Then foreigners came in with outside wealth and started taking land and exploiting the natural resources. Become a part of the States is just the final kick in the shin, I mean I'd be pissed if someone essentially swept 80% of my house from under me then started renting it out for more than even I could afford. For your questions - I'm not a native hawaiian, I just listened/read a lot about the history when I was there since it was interesting to know where I was on the islands and what happened there.

Tbh hardly a hypocrite. Obviously musk wants to sell his electric cars, that's why he made them in the first place. They ARE emission free after all.

tencent invests in everything, so I really doubt their involvement with reddit is significant. If anything, reddit is easy to game just by using the platform itself - no investment needed. There are tons of fake russian accounts on this site drumming up dissent	whitepeoplegifs	1579644066
&gt; I find it a worrying trend how easily Reddit is blindly up-voting these gifs and supporting a company with such privacy concerns, an obvious agenda, and that is censoring and controlling the information you see.So while I dont disagree with your criticism - nobody has definitive proof that this data is being used for malicious surveillance or they'd have already been dropped by Facebook since companies like that have huge technical investigation teams to make sure this DOESN'T happen. The article alleging sending data to china is also a non-article because ITS BASED IN CHINA - it does not prove anything about WHAT is happening to it.I don't think its vote manipulation either because its a hugely popular app that lends itself to very fast content creation -its no more manipulation than posting gifs. I'm definitely wary of the app and don't use it myself - but this is largely conjecture. You cannot definitively prove that the data is being used by the government because there is no way to prove that outside of you setting up a complex honeypot account and somehow finding out where the data is surfacing on the other end - which is near impossible if it's actually happening and 100% impossible if it's not happening.	whitepeoplegifs	1579644421
It doesn't matter what I suspect - it matters what you can prove and then action on.Lets say you work for facebook or google. How can you prove that this is happening to TikTok and take their app down? Simply stating that it's developed in China is not a good enough reason to ban it.	whitepeoplegifs	1579748663
&gt; They want to figure out everyone's birthday so they can send them a cake. Which is a legitimate use case. Everything you stated is conjecture which is why this is a difficult case and why TikTok is still up on google play/ios. You need to definitively prove that this is happening and once the data enters China... it's very very hard to do that.	whitepeoplegifs	1579748805

dude you have answered your own issue here. &gt; You really think a society of only women wouldn't make war?No, nobody is saying that. Open a history book and on a timeline, point to when women got the right to vote then compare it to the rest of history. It's really ok to give men a little bit of credit for the good/bad in that. Seriously, we'll be ok. You're also arguing against a 4 minute george carlin bit set to the visuals of Fury Road. This isn't a research article.	movies	1579846313
&gt; I like George Carlin, but the "all the problems in the world were created by men" narrative ignores the simple fact that women have been excluded from positions of power, authority and influence. &gt; Or, in large part, were they just not given equal opportunity to fuck up as much as men, historically?Yes? That's exactly what he's saying. If men were in charge for 99% of the time then it's pretty fair to say they're responsible for whatever did or didn't happen. If you replaced the genders I'm sure you could make the same statement. I'm not sure what your point is.	movies	1579846628

lol this has always been part of dubstep culture, since 2005 at least. releasing tracks is hard - mixing, mastering, promotion, finding a label, paying for distribution etc.. all takes tons of times and sometimes things fall through.

nvidia just makes better cards. In the low-mid cost market there's a choice sure, but if you just want the fuckoff best GPU you are buying nvidia.	pcgaming	1581899721
price-wise, yes you're right - if you have a budget under $600 for a GPU I agree that AMD makes more sense (some of the time anyway). But AMD unfortunately just can't compete w/ the high performance nvidia offerings. So when high-end nvidia cards drop in price (new or used) they are still a better choice. Except right now i guess, the 2080ti is stupid expensive and not worth it for anyone	pcgaming	1581914950

it really isn't the same at all - toyota and VW have colossal product lines and output, and that's not even factoring in their luxury brands. It would be ridiculous for them to pivot into being technology-first car companies like tesla. Why would they? How many Camrys sell in the US compared to model 3s? Its barely competition and it's not like the two have overlapping markets anyway.Blockbuster and netflix were both methods to watch the same movie. But the buyer of Toyota is generally NOT going to be choosing between a Model X and a Sienna.	technology	1581982190
...keep in mind you're accusing TOYOTA of planned obsolescence.	technology	1581982319
yea hopefully a 2x16gb surfaces sometime. I have a asus maximus XI  HERO Z290 so should be able to do 4133 otherwise	buildapcsales	1581982880
yea also how tf are they not innovating? They're slowly gaining all the self-driving features tesla has. Of course you're not gonna see that in a base-level camry but Audi/Lexus are certainly not struggling.	technology	1581982965
Top comment right now is basically "car makers won't put new tech into cars because they dont want to innovate" as if replacing a center console w a giant ipad is the end-all of car technology. when it comes to a 4ton fast moving vehicle, maybe you DON'T want to rush things? Toyota/Lexus has been top of reliability for decades for a reason.	technology	1581983094
Tesla cannot make enough cars to meet demand and the company itself is largely afloat because of POTENTIAL profits by VC money. While I am very happy they exist and they are pushing technology forward, tesla is a tech company first and car company second. They don't bring anything particularly innovating like Netflix vs Blockbuster either. They're still making cars at the end of the day, and most of their special features can be found in luxury brands	technology	1581989619
Lol maybe jumping the gun w "autopilot" didn't help, but I'll accept my hyperbole not being much better than that comment I cited. Either way I think it's silly to say Toyota isn't "innovating" just because they didn't scrap 10 million cars a year to become Tesla 2.0	technology	1581996081
And Tesla's never have issues either? Like glitchy autopilot leading to death? What's your point lol. A Lexus ls400 hit 1 million miles a few years ago and all Toyotas regularly last over 100k miles.	technology	1582041015

"contracts and stuff" like the terms of service they already have, and that were enforced following CA's discovery?	technology	1583810651
didn't they still increase the core count though? iirc the 8700k has 6core/12 threads, so the 9700K going to 8/8 isn't too big of a 'downgrade' depending on use case. I think his point is that they purposefully locked some chip functionality to be able to sell it for less - whereas in theory all 9700K chips could have had hyperthreading. But that's how this industry works - GPUs are binned and features are disabled to create various tiers of cards. It's not 'misleading' its just how silicon works.	pcmasterrace	1583870870

It'd be like me complaining that Half Life Alyx should be on PS4. Also if it werent for exclusivity, Steam would command the entire market - which if you remember was the main reason the platform hasn't done shit to innovate until Discord ate their chat lunch and Origin + others started creating actual competition. But I digress, I think it's a fun game and if you're not gonna buy it now just because it used to be on Epic, you would have never bought it anyway so their decision to take Epics money was the right one.	pcgaming	1585159832

 i have the same opinion - I think a lot of the choices they made as far as getting ammo, armor etc are more frustrating than challenging. The entire game is basically just glory killing animations which IMO isn't as fun as 2016 was.	ShouldIbuythisgame	1585526767

Since nobody else is actually trying to change your view: you cannot TECHNICALLY prove that it is a surveillance program.It CAN be exploited, and everything you mentioned COULD be possible. However can you definitively prove that the data is being used this way? No because it's near impossible to prove this is actually technically occurring, which is why the TikTok app is still on google play/ios store. A lot of this thread is pure conjecture. Unless someone actually works for the CCP here and can show a database containing TikTok data - all we have is suspicion.	changemyview	1585684967
&gt; Forever. In a database that is keyword searchableIf this was actually possible it would be absurdly impressive.	changemyview	1585685148
we can BUT it's still an assumption and is based on perceived risk rather than tangible evidence. Technically proving this type of data transfer is happening is impossible without insider knowledge (i.e. Snowden + NSA). Even with the examples you mentioned, it would depend on how the data collection is occurring - whether an agency has API access or is using web scraping is something only those companies + the government can confirm, which is still insanely difficult since web-scraping is hard to track. For TikTok it'd be impossible to definitively prove since the data collection would be happening from their database.	changemyview	1585693430
not necessarily true, you can know 100% that an API call is made and what data is retrieved if you have access to that database. I work in a data investigation field and this is how we confirm whether or not there is risk to data. You can log IPs and determine what requests are being made and look for unusual traffic patterns. In theory you could create a "honeypot" account for TikTok and evaluate the application based on where that data ends up. But you'd still need to know where that is :P I don't agree that you can rely on the value of exploitation being proof that it's happening. You can infer, you can calculate risk, but at the end of the day you are still making an assumption and that won't lead to policy decisions. Should you personally use TikTok? That's up to you but as a whole it's disingenuous to say they're DEFINITELY sending data to the chinese gov't.	changemyview	1585694570
&gt; I think one can make an informed decision and come to by far the most likely possibility: they are almost certainly using useful data that is out there to be used. Including social media apps used prolifically by millions of citizens of a competing superpower and potential adversary.Oh I fully agree here, I was just putting a counterargument to OP since he did ask for a challenge to this viewpoint. I just want to say that in reality, this is *probably* happening. I just wouldn't want to say it's DEFINITELY happening. &gt; That 100% certainty you're talking about is not really 100%. Its a philosophical kind of argument, but it is relevant here. Its just close enough that we can take it to be 100%. Nothing - truly, nothing - has truth value 100% other than that we know we can somehow think.Eh honestly I still disagree here - I'm not coming at this from a philosophical standpoint, just technical + data driven. Like is there actual, tangible evidence. Anyway again, you're right that for all intents and purposes TikTok is at the very least suspicious and we should be wary. But OP's claim that it's SPECIFICALLY a Chinese surveillance app? Plausible, likely, probable - but not definitive.Basically, I wouldn't ban it, but I'd tell people to stop using it.	changemyview	1585700638

Saying it's "not excitement" is the stretch. IF you've been driving 90K sports cars your entire life then you probably shouldn't comment about whats exciting lol because what youre used to is way out there to begin with.

I mean obviously, but the gs350 ticked all the boxes for me. There's a huge difference in a 2000 crown vic and a 2015 lexus. That aside, I think a lot of people in this sub are too used to high performance vehicles so don't think anything under 400hp and over 3K pounds is "sporty". My car has 300hp and I think its quite fun when I need it to be. Plus Op named a hybrid crossover (UX) as "not exciting" which is... well no shit?	cars	1585876983

&gt; Seems like we rarely hear about devs suing or shutting down the pieces of shit selling these cheatsthat's because it is not newsworthy. these sites get taken down all the time but they pop back up because it is easy to get hosting. If you violate a companies terms of service they can send you a cease &amp; desist (if they have the means to). Its often hard to find the owner of the site so they have to go to the hosting company and that adds more friction + time for action to be taken. &gt;  I want to reserve the notion the devs just don't care enough for that hassle.That's not true, but as a thought exercise how would YOU do it? How would you find who developed a hack, determine whether they did so in a way that violated ToS, then begin legal proceedings? How long of a process + how much would this cost?

The real question is "and then what" which would be impossible for anyone to prove short of working at tiktok or the CCP and having access to their databases.Best case scenario there's some kind of CCP SDK that could be found, but this isn't the case either because then it'd have been taken down by apple/google already.

Honestly not surprised - barely any changes in the last 4 years, plus declining sedan sales means most buyers are opting for the IS/RC for sportiness or the ES for comfort. I only got my GS because i'm 6'4" and would never have fit into an IS350	Lexus	1587686339

&gt; "I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute... And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets inside the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”READ ITholy fuck why are you defending this?	pics	1587774760
He said "disinfectant".	pics	1587775203

wow yea its such a huge lie to say lysol instead of disinfectant damn libearls owned again	pics	1587778354
then why didn't he say that? Something eloquent such as "by the same way that disinfectant kills germs, we should seek to create a vaccine that would eradicate the virus"?I just made that up. Why then?	pics	1587798997
fuck you, he lies about every other thing, constantly moving the goal posts. you aren't out for shit if you are defending "OH WELL HE DIDNT SPECIFICALLY SAY LYSOL, HE SAID DISINFECTANT"Would you get up in arms if people accused obama of saying kleenex would have cured SARS but he actually said tissues? Jesus christ.	pics	1587802865
Keep splitting hairs you autist, this is the most retarded hill to die on. Lysol is the same as disinfectant, the original message still stands and no lie was told. Your version of the truth is just moving goalposts to appear smart and principled, but what's important is you still managed to make a fuss about it	pics	1587842437
it's really not that bad. I got a ps4 to play red dead 2 and spiderman and it was perfectly playable, plus a ps4 pro does 60fps most of the time. My PC is able to play RDR2 at 80fps at 1440p now and while it obviously looks better I still had a good time on the ps4.good gameplay will always make a game shine	pcgaming	1587843812
this is 100% confirmation bias. you are welcome to capture the traffic your phone sends and look for yourself. your phone battery would be dead after a few hours of "listening in".	Android	1587845551
yea anything w/ aiming sucks. RDR2 was ok since it would lock on, and spiderman is the type of game that'd be better w a controller anyway - but boy i cannot wait to play HZD again with a mouse...	pcgaming	1587849058
you're still equating experience to technical ability which IMO isn't fair to judge. The 'experience' of using a switch is you can play BOTW anywhere, like an airplane. Or bringing it to play mario kart with your friends - not something you can do with a PC. If it were truly one or the other it would always make sense to get games on PC but if there is no chance of that or you'd have to wait another 4-5 years for a PC release (like for HZD) then getting a used PS5 isn't the equivalent of cutting your arm off.	pcgaming	1587930304
Shadow of War. I thought Shadow of Mordor was alright but after seeing seeing how much work was left to do to get the fortresses up I just gave up - gameplay wasn't nearly fun enough to justify that much busywork.Also gave up on Shadow of the Tomb Raider near the end. Game was pretty but ended up feeling like a chore.Maybe I should avoid games w/ "Shadow" in the title	pcgaming	1587930526
Interestingly I find that Larry's problems still seem universal to me. While I don't have a country club to go to his inability to deal with minor inconveniences is still hilarious. The whole recent season w/ the 'spite storefronts' was terrific and petty	television	1587935295
I wouldn't say bad, but definitely not memorable.	television	1587935342
yea plus his jokes are less so "this rich people thing is annoying" but more so "this person is being too friendly and its irritating". His financial ability to escalate something into the next level of pettiness is actually great because I'm sure we've all wished we had the money to go to those lengths.	television	1587936990
yikesplease go inject yourself w some disinfectant as per trumps suggestions	television	1587937186
the president should stop giving out healthcare advice then	television	1587937220
yea I understand. To me those examples still feel universal like his pettiness to wanting to upstage someone, being vain and trying to avoid weight limits, trying to dodge regulations because you're too lazy to change anything yourself, etc even though the specific situations are posh as hell. But I will say that he's one of my favorite writers and seinfeld/curb are some of my favorite shows so I'd be on board no matter what, and can't really objectively judge this. Like I saw Idris Elba had a show about himself and rolled my eyes.. whereas here I am defending larry david for doing the same thing twice... for 9 seasons at a time.	television	1587937855

it never sold that well and most people go for the RC-F anyway. Lets be honest sedans are dying in general so its not surprising. that said I do hope I can get a GS F at some point, although that might go the way of the Chevy SS and appreciate instead	Lexus	1588135780

Well that is definitely... something. We're really leaning on the line of "just because you can doesn't mean that you should".Although on the other hand, it's good that people are pushing boundaries of video game making, even if its in weird and off-putting directions.	pcgaming	1588287312

I'm not surprised at all - I'd be uber leadership has never even considered that people would stop using it. Shortsighted and in pure denial.	bayarea	1588791977
Uber is fully capable of diversifying, as theyve shown w funding autonomous cars, ubereats, etc. Also it's not like taxis weren't aware of why people immediately jumped to uber/lyft when they showed up, they just did nothing with that information.They have also barely turned a profit and have been relying on investor money this entire time, so it was a matter of time before shit finally hit the fan.	bayarea	1588804379
&gt; Did you consider that the Taxi companies did nothing because Uber/Lyft were operating a nearly identical business model but with lower prices fueled by investor money and an unsustainable pricing model?Yea this didn't happen overnight either. They got more investor money when the success happened because everyone hated cab companies - for shitty service, shitty cars, terrible booking, and inconsistent payment methods. It became clear that this wasn't going to change. And you don't have to go back too far in Ubers history to see they took Facebooks 'move fast and break things' motto to a very far extreme. That company has had enough scandals to make an anthology of Aaron Sorkin movies. So yea I don't think they ever planned on having a rainy day fund for this type of drop in use OR emphasis on their other products to make up for revenue. I'm not sure what you're arguing with me about.They're a massive corporation - not someones single yelllowcab lol, so yea I would expect them to have a plan.	bayarea	1588808189
well yea no shit, but thats not what monitors are for. Monitors are specifically designed to give a flat sound while consumer speakers are purposefully eq'd to sound ""good"". Not to mention vastly more expensive, I paid something like $400 per unit for my Sceptre S6s.Seeing as how people are talking about Corsair speakers I don't think they should be in the market for Genelecs or w/e	buildapcsales	1588819484
genelecs are like $800+ per speaker monitors is my point and are definitely not intended for casual listening, so i really don't think ppl should be buying studio monitors for gaming and normal usage - it would be terrible value	buildapcsales	1588830811
yea its not like anyone with a 7700k will be (or should be) buying these. I will say the 7700k OC'd exceptionally well which probably puts it decently ahead still, but if you're looking for a new CPU its a no brainer	pcmasterrace	1588899590
You're right but it's still pretty inconsequential. People buying a 10900K aren't going to be keeping it for its lifespan. Taking it down from 10 years to 8/9 shouldn't dissuade people from overclocking.Power costs (depending on area) are like $20 a year at most. The heat thing though... yea I am feeling that one right now with my i9.	pcmasterrace	1588899768

Dubstep as a whole is just fine - but personally I'm over this subreddit. I like maybe 1/30 tracks posted here now. I really hate riddim and screechy shit, so mostly in /r/realdubstep now.	dubstep	1589476382
