Which Guitar Looper Allows for *'Unlayering'* Back to the Origin Loop? Most, like the 2005 JamMan, only allow for an undo of the last layer.

Why doesn't CMPE teach or even address Quantum Computing? (call out to 'slugstructor') Last quarter Professor Guthaus claimed quantum computers were only up to 7 qbits which is way off the mark (I didn't want to interrupt his lecture and correct without facts in hand). Is it departmental territory stuff, like Physics gets the quantum stuff, or is it lack of forward thinking vision. It seems like most of 'us' BSOE types will be dealing with quantum in the next 20- years no problem?

Why is the U.S. university music system so locked onto Western Art music ( classical )? It's as if Med schools still taught leeching and Physics departments never taught passed Newton. O.K. some schools do Jazz ( not mine ) but even that's begrudgingly. Uni's in Europe and elsewhere offer Hindustani Performance B.A.'s (London) and Rock/ Pop or traditional folk ( see the Royal Academy of Music Stockholm which is way into their indigenous Northern European music ). There is a huge wealth of traditional folk in the US that could be a track at Uni but is ignored due to the dominance of the classical system that is ingrained from grade-school up.ok rant aside I want a music comp BA - I read music, write my own instrumentals, understand theory ( have taken Theory-I, and am in music history ), I understand my piano requirements, but I never was in school band, and I don't play a classical instrument ( just guitar(non-classical/non-jazz) and dobro) so I can't figure how to satisfy ensemble requirements? any ideas ? thanks	IAmA	1285811978

As a Busker, and I've discussed this video with others, Joshua Bell was in a really bad spot for busking.

several logic /factual flaws;  There are several reasons to be vegan--health (a no cholesterol diet), environmental concerns(earth cannot support everyone eating meat at the level we do in the U.S,, meat production is a waste of energy, subsidized meats like tyson chicken are fed themselves as feed (ala the Matrix) and have huge , hidden transportation costs getting these corporate meats to market and the ensuing pollutioneating local, organic is the best way to go and should dissuade any concerns for workers rights brought up in the comedy piece.

It is also known as a way of farming practice of growing large stands of a single species.

However, monocultures can lead to the quicker spread of diseases, where a uniform crop is susceptible to a pathogen.

trying to get the link uphttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jjr1c/black_people_why_do_you_name_your_kids_ridiculous/	AskReddit	1313448074
in the post the op says the names are "stupid" and "not normal"--what does that mean or imply?--to me this ethnocentric (white culture being the implied "normal") view is at the very least ignorant-- also saying that an entire group of people are "stupid" is a textbook example of racism--unacceptable	AskReddit	1313448848
but it's more like the op is annoyed by the culture, saying it's "not normal" and "stupid" to invent names--he's coming at this not from the position of an inquisitive anthropologist, but more like a judgmental white racist	AskReddit	1313449153
again, it's the attitude of the op using terms like "stupid" and "not normal" that make this racist	AskReddit	1313449213
it becomes racist when you pass judgement like the op in the thread does--the names are "stupid" because they don't conform to the "rules of language"--ie. his white pre-conceptions of what names are proper	AskReddit	1313450049
here's the first thread,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jjr1c/black_people_why_do_you_name_your_kids_ridiculous/and my response thread,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jju5s/why_is_reddit_racist_why_are_threads_like_this/	todayilearned	1313461221
why is "it" hilarious--"I think another culture is strange and 'not normal' and what they do is 'stupid' therefore I'll laugh at them"--I'm sorry, I can get on board with this "funny ha-ha" thinly veiled racism stuff that is all too prevalent on Reddit	AskReddit	1313472304

1)the first question is still valid2)so you're saying Cate Blanchett does appear in the Harry Potter films?-cool!3) it's not funny if you have to explain it4) other people had that problem so you're not gonna make me cry5)  you sure about bigfoots?6) you conveniently skipped over my most recent posts regarding Reddit's racist tendencies	AskReddit	1313648105
because the op said the naming practice was "stupid" and "not normal" he was annoyed, put out, angry that these people do this---he appears to have since edited his original post toning it down with gloating --still saying what another culture does is "ridiculous" is at the very least intolerant	AskReddit	1313649649
I'm gonna have to disagree with your ethnocentric "stupid" assertion--sticking with the original topic of  "ghetto" names this brief article sums up my position very well and explains better than I can how that post was offensivehttp://www.datalounge.com/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=9542689#page:showThread,9542689	AskReddit	1313652162
it has everything to do with "being black, their history and racism" These people lost their names--taken away, but they also lost connection to their history and culture, thrown from the plantations straight into the slums and generational poverty--they don't give a fuck about Africa that's not what they know or care about (I'm generalizing here) --so they come up with names to reflect the consumer culture that surrounds them, that's shoved down their throats-- and what? we get to sit back in our Reddit high chair and ridicule and pass judgement?-- no fucking way!	AskReddit	1313653362
but why do they have to name them African names-- as far as they are concerned they're not from Africa and know nothing about it-- you know history, you have an education, the folks in the ghetto are lucky to get passed eighth grade-- you have to realize it's a different world, a different culture that what you are living in--take that step and we can all get somewhere togetherfollowing your logic- do I have to give my kids traditional Italian names--names that people would have trouble pronouncing and spelling and possible lead to ridicule in grade school?
